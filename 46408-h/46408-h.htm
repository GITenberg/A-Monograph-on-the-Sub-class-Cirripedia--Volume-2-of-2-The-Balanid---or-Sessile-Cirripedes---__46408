<p>Having so lately, in my volumes on the Recent and Fossil Lepadidæ,
expressed as strongly as I could, and with the utmost sincerity,
the obligations under which I lie to very many naturalists, I will
not here repeat my thanks, and will only say that the assistance
formerly rendered me from so many quarters has been most kindly
continued without intermission. The references under the Habitats,
in which I may remark the names of Mr. Cuming and of Mr. Stutchbury,
and of the British Museum, so often recur, show my deep obligations
to these gentlemen and to Dr. Gray, and indeed to most of the
British and several Foreign<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[1]</span></a> collectors of recent and fossil
shells. At the period when the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a> to this volume was
printed, I stated that I did not know whether the Palæontographical
Society would publish the few British fossil <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>; the<a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii" href="#Page_viii"><span class="pagenum">[Pg viii]</span></a> Council
has now honoured me by determining on this publication, so that
these species will hereafter be more fully illustrated than they
could be in the present volume. I cannot conclude this short
preface, without again tendering my most grateful thanks to the
Council of the Ray Society for the publication of my two volumes,
and for the very kind manner in which they have acceded to all my
requests.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION" />INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>My former volume, published by the Ray Society, treated only of the
Lepadidæ, one family of the Cirripedia: I was induced to print it from
having the materials ready, though this partial publication has been
in some respects inconvenient. The Palæontographical Society has done
me the honour to publish, with ample illustrations, the fossil
species of this same family of Lepadidæ. This present volume
completes my work on the sub-class Cirripedia.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[2]</span></a> I had originally
intended to have published a small volume on my anatomical
observations; but the full abstract given in my former volume, which
will be illustrated to a certain extent in the plates appended to this
volume, together with the observations here given under the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>,
appear to me sufficient, and I am unwilling to spend more time on
the subject. In the volume on the Lepadidæ, I gave the specific or
diagnostic characters in English and Latin: I have here left out the
latter, inasmuch as I have appended at the end of this volume a Latin
Synopsis of all the<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2" href="#Page_2"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span></a> species, recent and fossil, of the whole class. To
each species is added a reference to the pages and plates of my three
volumes, so that the Synopsis will serve as a systematic index to the
three: an alphabetical index to the present volume is also given. In
the Lepadidæ, I gave an additional specific character, derived from
the softer parts of the animal's body: in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, these parts are
more alike in the different species, and I have found it impossible to
give a diagnostic character thus derived. In those cases in which a
Family contains but one genus, or a Genus but one species, I have
assigned my reasons for the institution of such groups, but have given,
as heretofore, only a single description in full: it would have been
easy to have separated, by analogy, this description into one for the
species, another for the genus or for the family; but as I believe such
separation and subordination of the characters would have been largely
conjectural, I have thought it best to act as I have done, and give,
thus saving useless repetitions, only a single description, and leave it
for my successors, when more genera or species are known, to separate,
with such certainty as is ever possible, the generic from the specific
characters.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The number of the British fossil species of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> and
<a href="#Family_Verrucidae">Verrucidæ</a> in a recognisable state is so small, that I do not know whether
it will be considered worth while to publish in the Palæontographical
series more detailed illustrations than are given in this volume.</p></div>

<p>In nomenclature, I have endeavoured rigorously to follow the rules of the
British Association, and have never, at least intentionally, broken
through the great law of priority. In accordance with the rules, I have
rejected, that is, as compulsory, all names given before the introduction
of the binomial system in 1758. I have given much fewer synonyms than is
usual in conchological works; for it is impossible to recognise with any
approach to certainty, several even of the common European forms, in the
short descriptions given by most authors; this holds good in many cases in
which figures, in appearance excellent, have been added. I assert this the
more confidently, from having had the advantage of having gone over some
of the Linnean synonyms with Mr. S. Hanley. I may further venture to
express my conviction, that giving references to works, in which there is
not any original matter, or in which the plates are not of a high order of
excellence, is absolutely injurious to the progress of natural history.</p>

<p>Sessile Cirripedes, partly from being attached to surfaces <a name="Page_3" id="Page_3" href="#Page_3"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span></a>having very
different characters, partly from undergoing a varying amount of
disintegration, and partly from unknown innate causes, are extremely
variable. Under the head of <i>Variation</i>, <a href="#Page_155">in the Family Balanidæ</a>
and <a href="#Page_184">under the Genus Balanus</a>, I have enlarged on this subject, and have
shown that there is scarcely a single <em>external</em> character which
is not highly variable in most of the species. As whole groups of
specimens often vary in exactly the same manner, it is not easy to
exaggerate the difficulty of discriminating species and varieties. It
is absolutely necessary in most cases, for mere identification, that
the valves of at least one specimen in a group should be disarticulated
and well cleaned (for which purpose caustic potash is most useful), so
that the internal characters may be examined. Whoever attempts to make
out from external characters alone, without disarticulating the valves,
the species, (even those inhabiting one very confined region, for
instance the shores of Great Britain,) will almost certainly fall into
many errors: hence it is, and can thus only be accounted for, that I
have not seen one collection of British specimens with <em>all</em> the
species, though so few in number, rightly discriminated; and in the
large majority of cases, either two or three species, certainly
distinct, were confounded together, or two or three varieties, as
certainly not distinct, were separated from each other.</p>

<div class="no-section">
<h3 class="center"><a name="Names_Given" id="Names_Given" /><i>On the Names Given to the Different Parts of Cirripedes.</i></h3>

<p>In my former volume I have stated that I found it indispensable, in part
owing to the extreme confusion of the nomenclature previously used, to
attach new names to several of the external parts of Cirripedes. Almost
all these names are applicable to the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, or sessile Cirripedes,
and to the <a href="#Family_Verrucidae">Verrucidæ</a>; but a few additional names are requisite, which,
together with the old names, will, I hope, be rendered clear by the
accompanying woodcuts. In sessile Cirripedes, the whole of that which is
externally visible, may for convenience sake be divided into the<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" href="#Page_4"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span></a>
<i>operculum</i> or <i>opercular valves</i> (<i>valvæ operculares</i>), and the
<i>shell</i> (<i>testa</i>), though these parts homologically present no
real difference. The operculum is seated generally some little way down
within the <i>orifice</i> of the shell; but in very young specimens and
in <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>, the operculum is attached to the summit of the shell, and
the shell, without the operculum <span class="correction" title="In the original book: be">being</span> removed, can hardly be said to have
any orifice; though, of course, the opercular valves themselves have an
aperture for the protrusion of the cirri.</p>

<p>The shell consists of the <i>basis</i> (called the support by some
authors), which is membranous or shelly, and flat or cup-formed, and of
the <i>compartments</i> (<i>testæ valvæ</i>), which vary from eight to
four in number, and occasionally are all calcified together.</p>

<p>The compartment, at that end of the shell where the cirri are exserted
through the aperture or lips of the operculum, is called the
<i>carina</i> (fig. <a href="#w3f01">1</a>); the compartment opposite to it is the
<i>rostrum</i>,—these two lying at the ends of the longitudinal axis of
the shell. Those on the sides are the <i>lateral compartments</i>;
that nearest the carina, being the <i>carino-lateral</i> (<i>testæ
valva carino-lateralis</i>), that nearest the rostrum, the
<i>rostro-lateral</i>, and the middle one, simply the <i>lateral</i>
compartment; but these three compartments are rarely present together.
The <i>rostro-lateral</i> compartment, which always resembles fig. <a href="#w3f02">2</a>,
and may be always known by having radii on both sides, is often absent;
and not rarely the lateral and carino-lateral compartments are
confounded together, or one is absent; in such cases the compartment
that is left is simply called the lateral one. The compartments are
separated from each other by <i>sutures</i>, which are often so fine
and close as to be distinguished with difficulty. The edge of a
compartment, which can only be seen when disarticulated from its
neighbour, I have called the sutural edge (<i>acies suturalis</i>).</p>

<p>Each separate <i>compartment</i> consists of a <i>wall</i> (<i>paries</i>), or
<i>parietal portion</i> (<i>pp</i> in woodcuts), which always grows downwards,
and forms the basal margin; and is furnished on the two sides either
with <i>alæ</i> (fig. <a href="#w3f04">4</a>), or with <i>radii</i> (fig. <a href="#w3f02">2</a>), or with an ala
on one side and a radius (fig. <a href="#w3f03">3</a>) on the other.</p>

<p><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" href="#Page_5"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span></a></p>

<p>The <i>radius</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[3]</span></a> (adopting the name used by Bruguière, Lamarck, and
others) differs remarkably in appearance (though not in essence) from
the walls or parietal portion, owing to the direction of the lines of
growth and the state of its usually depressed surface. In the upper part
the radii overlie the alæ of the adjoining compartments: in outline
(<i>r</i>, fig. <a href="#w3f01">1</a>, <a href="#w3f02">2</a>, <a href="#w3f03">3</a>), they are wedge-formed, with their points
downwards; their summits (and this is often a useful specific character)
are either parallel to the basis or as in fig. <a href="#w3f01">1</a> and <a href="#w3f02">2</a>, oblique. The
radii are sometimes not developed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The radii have been called by Ranzani and De Blainville "areæ depressæ"
(the parietal portions of the compartments being the "areæ prominentes"); by
Poli, "areæ interjectæ;" by Gray, "sutures;" by Coldstream, "compartments
of the second order," (the parietal portions being those of the first order); by
some authors as <span class="correction" title="In the original book, the punctuation was outside the quotes.">"intersticia."</span> I may here add that the scuta are the "ventral
valves" of Gray, the "anterior" of Ranzani, and the "inferior opercular" of
De Blainville: the terga are the "posterior valves" of Gray and Ranzani, but
the "superior opercular" of De Blainville: the rostrum, on the other hand, is the
"anterior valve" of Ferussac and the "ventral" of De Blainville; the carina
being the "dorsal valve" of the latter author.</p></div>

<p>The <i>alæ</i> (so called by Dr. Gray) are overlapped by the
radii and by part of the walls; they usually extend only
about half way down the compartment (<i>a</i> fig. <a href="#w3f03">3</a>, <a href="#w3f04">4</a>, <a href="#w3f01">1</a>);
their summits are either parallel to the basis or oblique.
The alæ of the several compartments, together with the
internal, upper, thickened surfaces of the walls, against a
shoulder of which the sutural edges of the alæ abut, have
been called (by Dr. Gray) the <i>sheath</i> (<i>vagina</i>). The upper
and greater portion of the sheath is marked by transverse
lines, caused by the exuviation of the <i>opercular membrane</i>,
as that membrane may be called, which unites the operculum
all round to the sheath, or upper internal surface of the
shell.</p>

<p>The <i>carina</i> has always two <i>alæ</i>, as in fig. <a href="#w3f04">4</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>carino-lateral</i> and <i>lateral compartments</i> have always
an <i>ala</i> on one (the rostral) side, and a <i>radius</i> on the other
(the carinal) side, as in fig. <a href="#w3f03">3</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>rostro-lateral compartment</i> (when present) has always
<i>radii</i> on both sides, as in fig. <a href="#w3f02">2</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>rostrum</i> has normally <i>alæ</i> on both sides, as in fig. <a href="#w3f04">4</a>,
but very often from fusion with the rostro-lateral compartments
on both sides, it has <i>radii</i> on both sides, as in fig. <a href="#w3f02">2</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" href="#Page_6"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span></a></p>

<p>The walls of the shell, the basis, and the radii, are in very
many cases composed of an <i>outer</i> and <i>inner lamina</i>, united
together by <i>longitudinal septa</i>; a set of tubes or pores being
thus formed. The points of the longitudinal septa generally
project beyond the laminæ, and are denticulated on
both sides (see woodcut, further on;) the septa are sometimes
branched, several irregular rows of pores between the
two laminæ being then formed (see Pl. <a href="#Page_691">7</a>, fig. <a href="#p07f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>, and
Pl. <a href="#Page_694">10</a>, fig. <a href="#p10f01g">1 <i>g</i></a>, <a href="#p10f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>).</p>

<p><i>Operculum</i>, or <i>opercular valves</i>.—These consist of a pair
of scuta and a pair of terga. They are joined to the sheath
of the shell by the <i>opercular membrane</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i> (woodcut <a href="#w3f05">5</a>): this valve is generally sub-triangular,
and its three margins are the <i>basal</i>, the <i>tergal</i>, so
called from being articulated with the tergum, and the
<i>occludent</i>, so called from opening and shutting against the
opposed valve. The angles are called from the adjoining
margins, as <i>basi-tergal</i>, &amp;c.; the upper angle being the apex.
The scutum is ordinarily articulated to the tergum by an
<i>articular ridge</i> (<i>crista articularis</i>), running up to the apex
of the valve, and by an <i>articular furrow</i>, which latter receives
the scutal margin of the tergum. The articular ridge, instead
of projecting straight up from the valve, when laid flat
on its external surface, often bends over to the tergal side,
and is then said to be <em>reflexed</em>. On the internal surface of
the valve, there is almost always an <i>adductor pit</i> or <i>cavity</i>
(<i>fossa adductoris</i>), for the attachment of the adductor scutorum
muscle: this pit is often bounded on its tergal and
basal sides, by a ridge, called the <i>adductor ridge</i> (<i>crista adductoris</i>),
which, in its upper part, is often confluent with
the articular ridge. Beneath the adductor ridge, in the
basi-tergal corner of the valve, there is often a <i>lateral-depressor
pit</i> (<i>fossa musculi lateralis depressoris</i>), for the attachment
of the so-called muscle; and this pit is sometimes
furnished with crests.</p>

<p><i>Tergum</i>, (woodcut <a href="#w3f06">6</a> and <a href="#w3f07">7</a>):—this valve, also, has three
margins, the <i>scutal</i>, <i>basal</i>, and <i>carinal</i>; its upper end, or
<i>apex</i>, is sometimes <em>beaked</em>; on the basal margin a <i>spur</i>
(<i>calcar</i>) depends; the outer surface of the valve is depressed
or longitudinally <i>furrowed</i> (<i>sulcus longitudinalis</i>) in the line<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" href="#Page_7"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span></a>
of the spur. The part called the spur is often so broad, that
the name becomes not very appropriate. The angles are
denominated, from the adjoining margins, as <i>basi-carinal</i>,
or <i>basi-scutal</i> angle, &amp;c. On the under side, in the upper
part, there is an <i>articular ridge</i>, and on its scutal side, an
<i>articular furrow</i>, receiving the articular ridge of the scutum.
In the basi-carinal corner of the valve there are often crests
for the attachment of the tergal depressor muscle.</p>

<p><i>Sack</i>, <i>Body</i>, <i>Cirri</i>, <i>Mouth</i>.—A slit-like orifice between
the opercular valves leads into the <i>sack</i>, in which the body is
lodged. The body consists of the six (perhaps the seven)
posterior thoracic segments of the archetype Crustacean; the
first of these six segments (or first two, if there be seven
segments) is developed on its dorsal aspect into a part,
which I have called the <i>prosoma</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[4]</span></a> (see fig. <a href="#p25f01">1, <i>c</i></a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>).
There is no abdomen. The thoracic segments support six
pairs of <i>cirri</i>. Each cirrus consists of a two-jointed <i>pedicel</i>,
carrying two <span class="correction" title="In the original book: multi-articulated">multiarticulated</span> <i>rami</i>. Rarely there are
articulated <i>caudal appendages</i> (<i>appendices caudales</i>) on each
side of the anus. The prominent mouth consists of a
<i>labrum</i>, <i>palpi</i>, <i>mandibles</i>, <i>maxillæ</i>, and <i>outer maxillæ</i>, the
latter resembling a lower lip: these organs may be conveniently
spoken of, after Milne Edwards, as <i>gnathites</i>.
Within the sack, attached to its carino-lateral end, a folded
membrane forms the <i>branchiæ</i>. The sheets of ova lying
within the sack are called the <i>ovigerous lamellæ</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

head of the <a href="#Act_of_Metamorphosis">Metamorphoses of the Balanidæ</a>.</p></div>

<p>I have often found it convenient to designate the membrane
investing the body, lining the sack, &amp;c., by its proper
chemical name of <i>chitine</i>, instead of by horny, or other
such equivalents; but when covering parts of the shell, for
brevity's sake I have often spoken of it as an <i>epidermis</i>, but
I do not believe that such is its nature. When this membrane
sends into the body of the animal rigid projections or
crests, for the attachment of muscles or any other purpose,
I call them, after Audouin, <i>apodemes</i>. For the underlying
true skin, I use the term <i>corium</i>.</p>

<p><i>Relative position of parts.</i>—The centre of the generally
flat basis, which is cemented to the supporting surface, is<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" href="#Page_8"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span></a>
properly the <i>anterior</i> end, and the tips of the terga, often
hidden within the shell, are properly the <i>posterior</i> end of
the external covering; but I have found it more convenient
to speak of the <i>upper</i> and <i>basal</i> surfaces and aspects, which
hardly admit of any mistake. A line drawn from the centre
of the basis, along the middle of the rostrum to the tips of
the scuta, shows the strictly <i>medio-ventral</i> surface of the
shell; and another line drawn from the centre of the basis,
along the carina, to the tips of the terga, shows the strictly
<i>medio-dorsal</i> line; but from the crooked course of these
lines, I have found it far more convenient to speak of the
<i>rostral</i> and <i>carinal</i> end or aspect of the different parts of
the shell; this is the more necessary with respect to the internal
parts of the animal, owing to their remarkable changes
of position during the metamorphosis, whence it comes
that the dorsal surface of the thorax faces partly dorsally,
partly anteriorly or downwards, and partly even ventrally;
and the ventral surface of the whole posterior part of the
thorax faces upwards or posteriorly; but when we refer
these parts to the <i>rostral</i>, <i>carinal</i>, <i>basal</i>, and <i>upper</i> ends of
the shell, there can be no mistake. There has moreover
been great confusion in these relative terms, as applied by
different authors.</p>

<p>When a sessile Cirripede is held in the position in which
they have generally been figured, namely with the basis
downwards and the scuta towards the beholder, then the
<i>right</i> and <i>left</i> sides of the Cirripede correspond with those
of the holder.</p>

<p>I have followed the example of Botanists, and added the
interjection <span class="correction" title="In the original book: [!]">(!)</span> to synonyms, when I have seen an authentic
specimen bearing the name in question.</p>

<p>Every locality, under each species, is given from specimens
ticketed in a manner and under circumstances appearing
to me worthy of confidence,—the specific determination
being in each case made by myself.</p>

<p><i>Crustacea attached by the anterior end of the head, by
cement proceeding from a modified portion of the ovaria;
archetype composed of seventeen segments, with the three
first of large size, and almost always developed into a carapace,
not wholly exuviated, and capable of various movements;

formed by the partial confluence of the labrum, palpi, mandibles,

<p>Within the memory of many living naturalists, Cirripedes
were universally looked on as belonging to the Molluscous
kingdom; nor was this surprising, considering the fixed
condition of their shells, and the degree of external resemblance
between, on the one hand, Lepas and Teredo, and
on the other hand, between <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> and a Mollusc compounded
of a patella and chiton. It is remarkable that
this external false appearance overbore, even in the mind of
Cuvier, his knowledge of their internal structure, namely,
their lateral jaws, articulated appendages, and regular ganglionic
nervous system, which now strike us as such conclusive
evidence of their position in the great Articulate
kingdom. Straus<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[5]</span></a> was, I believe, the first who, in 1819,
maintained that Cirripedes were most closely allied to Crustacea.
But this view was disregarded, until J. Vaughan
Thompson's<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[6]</span></a> capital discovery, in 1830, of their metamorphoses,<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" href="#Page_10"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span></a>
since which time, Cirripedes have been almost universally
admitted amongst the Crustaceans. It is well
known, that it is hardly possible to give a definition of this
great class, which shall include every member of it; nevertheless,
even if the mature Cirripede alone be considered,
the following characters, viz. the slight separation of the
head and thorax, the latter generally bearing six pairs of
appendages, and the being enclosed in a carapace—together
with the periodical exuviation of the greater part of the
external membranes, would, perhaps, suffice to show that it
should be classed amongst Crustacea.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Mémoires du Muséum d'Histoire Nat., tom. v, p. 381.</p></div>

<p>But it still remains undecided what rank in this class
Cirripedes should hold. Before briefly discussing this point,
it is indispensable to indicate their essential characters,
which I will immediately attempt. For as long as it remained
doubtful which was their anterior extremity, which the ventral
or dorsal surface; as long as the peduncle was thought
by one naturalist to be the legs, by another the abdomen,
in a modified condition, it was hopeless to compare Cirripedes
with ordinary Crustaceans, and assign to them their due
rank.</p>

<p>In the larva in the first stage, an eye and two pairs of
antennæ are in process of formation or are developed; here,
then, according to the analogy of all Crustaceans, we have
evidence of the existence of the first three cephalic segments.
The mouth always consists of three pairs of gnathites,
and hence again, from analogy, this part may be inferred
to be formed of, and supported on, three other segments;
making thus far six segments. In two Orders out of the
three into which Cirripedes may be divided, namely, in the
<a href="#Order_Abdominalia">Abdominalia</a> and <a href="#Order_Apoda">Apoda</a>, eight quite distinct segments succeed
the mouth; of these the first differs slightly from the
seven succeeding segments, and may, I think, be safely
considered as forming the seventh (cephalic) segment.
The next seven segments resemble each other in all
essential respects, and are no doubt the normal, seven thoracic
segments. These, in both the above orders, are succeeded
by three smaller segments, which differ in structure
from the thoracic segments, and must be abdominal. Hence
we here have, altogether, seventeen segments. It should,<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" href="#Page_11"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span></a>
however, be observed that in the two orders just referred
to, each includes only a single species; but I know of no
good reason why, on this account, their structure should be
valued the less. In the third order, the <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>, which
includes all common Cirripedes, two segments with their
appendages are missing out of the eight that should succeed
the mouth; from the open interval in the pupa, between
the mouth and first pair of natatory legs, and from some
other reasons, I believe that the two missing segments are
the seventh and eighth, or last cephalic and first thoracic
segments, and that they have coalesced close posteriorly to
the mouth.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[7]</span></a> In the order <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>, the abdomen is quite
rudimentary, though often still bearing caudal appendages;
in the pupa, however, of this order, as in the mature animal
of the two other orders, it is formed of three segments.
Hence I conclude that, notwithstanding the absence of the
above two segments with their appendages in the <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>,
the archetype Cirripede may be safely said to be composed
of seventeen segments.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> This question and the whole subject of the homologies of the several parts
of a Cirripede, will be discussed under the head of the <a href="#Act_of_Metamorphosis">Metamorphoses of the
Balanidæ</a>.</p></div>

<p>In the classification of Crustacea, the relation and number
of the segments of the different parts of the body, are viewed
both by Prof. Milne Edwards<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[8]</span></a> and Mr. Dana,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[9]</span></a> as of the
highest importance. I may premise that both these authors
divide the Crustacea into Podophthalmia, Edriophthalmia,
and Entomostraca; Milne Edwards making a fourth
legion, the Branchiopoda, and another division, including
Limulus, of equal value to the above four legions altogether;
whereas Dana sinks Limulus and the Branchiopoda under
his Entomostraca. As far as concerns our present discussion
on Cirripedes, the first three divisions, as valued by Dana,
will best serve as standards of comparison; but it is not
unimportant to our present purpose, as showing how difficult
it is to weigh the value of the higher divisions of a
Class, to observe the wide difference in opinion of two naturalists,
so eminent for their <span class="correction" title="In the original book: knowlege">knowledge</span> of the class in question
and for their high abilities.</p>

<p>In the order <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>, including all common Cirripedes,
the cephalic and thoracic segments are as much confounded
together (but with coalescence and abortion of two middle
segments) as in most Podophthalmia; but in the two other
orders, the cephalic and thoracic segments are as distinct
as in the Edriophthalmia. The number of the segments,
however, which <em>strictly</em> appertain to the anterior part of the
head and mouth, being only six, is an Entomostracan character;
on the other hand, the first pair of cirri in the <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>,
has some claim from their position, apparent functions,
and separation from the succeeding pairs, to be said to belong
to the mouth; on which view, the first nine segments would,
in function, be cephalic, as in the highest Crustaceans. The
fewness of the segments of the abdomen, and their not
bearing in two of the orders appendages, is an Entomostracan character.</p>

<p>Cirripedes are permanently attached, even before their
final metamorphosis, by a tissue or cement, first debouching
through the second pair of antennæ, and, subsequently, in
most cases, through special orifices, penetrating the anterior
part of the head; this cement proceeds from glands, which
certainly are modified portions of the ovarian system. This
fact I consider of the highest classificatory importance, for it
is absolutely the one single character common to all Cirripedes,
besides such as show only that these animals belong
to the articulated kingdom, and are Crustaceans. No structure
of this kind has hitherto been observed in any other
member of the class or kingdom. Even in the Suctorial
Entomostracans, which become immoveably attached to the
fish on which they prey, the males are free; and the means
of attachment, as far as known, are quite different.</p>

<p>Both the first and second pairs of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: attennæ">antennæ</span> are absent
in the mature animal; for the three terminal segments of
the antennæ of the pupa, which may always be found cemented
under the centre of the surface of attachment, are
functionless, after maturity. The eyes are rudimentary,
and are singular from being seated far from the anterior
extremity of the head. In their rudimentary state, and
in the absence of antennæ, we have characters common
with certain Suctorial Entomostracans; and this similarity<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" href="#Page_13"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span></a>
apparently arises from the fixed condition of the animals of
both groups.</p>

<p>The carapace, which covers the dorsal surface of the
larva in the first stage, in the last larval or pupal stage is
developed so as to enclose, like a bivalve shell, the whole
body. In the mature Cirripede, the whole external covering,
whether shell and operculum, or capitulum and peduncle,
can be conclusively shown to be the carapace of the
pupa, modified. In thus enclosing the mouth and whole
body, the modified carapace resembles that of several Entomostracans;
but in being apparently formed (as I hope
hereafter to show) by the development of the third segment
of the head, and in consisting generally of distinct sclerodermic
plates, arranged in an imbricated order, there is,
I think, a closer resemblance to the same part in some of
the Podophthalmia. The carapace, or portions of the carapace,
being capable of other movements, besides merely
opening and shutting, differs, I believe, from that of all other
Crustaceans; as it likewise does<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[10]</span></a> in the greater part not
being periodically moulted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The carapace, however, of the Isaura, a Branchiopod, according to M. Joly
('Annales des Sc. Nat.,' 2 ser. vol. xvii, p. 293), is not moulted.</p></div>

<p>Moreover, in all Cirripedes there is another striking
peculiarity connected with these parts, namely, the exclusive
attachment of the whole thorax or included body to the
internal ventral or sternal surface of the carapace and head.
In the pupa, the thorax, as in all Crustaceans, opens into,
and is continuously united with, the large anterior part of
the head; but from the singular fact that the thorax of the
young Cirripede is developed not within the thorax, but
within the head of the pupa (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>), with its longitudinal
axis placed at right angles to that which it held in
the pupal condition (the mouth and the whole exterior being
developed conformably with that of the pupa), it comes to
pass after the metamorphosis, that the Cirripede is, as it
were, internally cut in twain (compare Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, and
Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, figs. <a href="#p30f02">2</a> and <a href="#p30f03">3</a>). Thus it is, as will hereafter be more
fully explained, that the sack originates, and thus the body
becomes attached to the internal ventral surface of the
carapace and front of head.</p>

<p><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" href="#Page_14"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span></a></p>

<p>The thorax in two of the Orders bears no appendages,
but in all common Cirripedes it is furnished with six pairs
of biramous, multiarticulated cirri, which have a peculiar
character, different from the limbs of other Crustaceans,
not being natatory, ambulatory, or branchial, but "captorial"
or fitted for sweeping the water, and thus catching prey.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[11]</span></a>
The cirri, at least the anterior pairs, can, besides other
movements, lengthen and shorten themselves; and this Milne
Edwards<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[12]</span></a> states is the case with the Podophthalmia, and is
considered by him as an important character. The cirri of
the first pair are attached on each side close to the bases
of the mandibles, and, as already remarked, have some claim
to be considered as maxillipeds or mouth organs. The three
or the four posterior pairs of cirri in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, form a
series somewhat distinct from the two or three anterior pairs,
thus recalling a characteristic feature in the Edriophthalmia.</p>

<p>The mouth is prominent, and is formed by the partial
confluence of the labrum, palpi, and lower segments of the
mandibles, and of two pairs of maxillæ; it is capable of
movement as a whole; in this respect we are reminded of
the Suctorial Entomostracans; but I believe the above type
of structure of the mouth is peculiar to Cirripedes.</p>

<p>The alimentary canal is simple, but can be distinctly
divided into—(1st) an œsophagus, singular from the bell-shaped
expansion of its lower end; (2d) the stomach,
which is directed forwards and then doubled back; and
(3d) the rectum. There is no distinct liver. The circulation
is lacunal. In one family there are well-developed
branchiæ, which differ entirely in their homologies and
position from these organs in all other Crustaceans. In the
nervous system, the sub-œsophageal ganglions vary in
concentration from that degree observed in the lower
Macroura, to that in the highest Brachyoura; but the supra-œsophageal
ganglions are always much less concentrated,
and are even embryonic in condition; presenting a difference
not observed in other Crustaceans. On the under side of the
sub-œsophageal ganglion, two nerves, apparently splanch<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" href="#Page_15"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span></a>nic,
arise, and run almost parallel and under the collar
surrounding the œsophagus; they are very remarkable from
their great size, and from forming a plexus together with
a large branch, arising on each side from the collar close
behind the supra-œsophageal ganglion,—a structure unlike
anything observed in other Crustaceans. The eyes, as
already remarked, are rudimentary, and singular from being
imbedded at a distance from the anterior end of the animal.
In the basal confluent segments of the outer maxillæ there
are two orifices, leading into little sacks, which I believe
are olfactory organs: again there are two other orifices on
each side of the thorax, beneath the first pair of cirri, leading
into sacks, with a curious elastic vesicle suspended within
them; and these I can hardly doubt are acoustic organs.
Of these orifices and organs, there is no trace in the same
relative positions in any known Crustacean.</p>

<p>Cirripedes are ordinarily bisexual, in which they differ
from all Crustaceans: when the sexes are separate, the
males are minute, rudimentary in structure, and permanently
epizoic on the females; to these latter facts we have
a partial analogy in some of the Suctorial Entomostracans;
but a far closer analogy in certain Rotifers, which are
considered by many naturalists as Crustaceans; but to the
above subject I shall almost immediately have to recur.</p>

<p>The male excretory organ is probosciformed and capable
of the most varied movements; it is single and medial; it
is seated (in the one instance in which this point can be
safely judged of) at the extremity of the abdomen, and
therefore near the normal position of the anus; in all
these respects there is a very great difference from other
Crustaceans, in which the male organs are laterally double,
and are not seated at the extremity of the abdomen. In
regard to the female organs, the ovarian tubes and cæca
inosculate together: there are no oviducts; the ova, connected
together by membrane, and so forming the "ovigerous
lamellæ," become exposed by the exuviation of the
lining tunic of the carapace or sack, and by the formation
of a new tunic on the under side of these lamellæ; a
process, I believe, unknown in other Crustaceans.</p>

<p>The metamorphoses are highly complex. The larva in<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" href="#Page_16"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span></a>
its first stage bears a very close general resemblance, in
having three pairs of natatory appendages, the first being
uniramous and the two others biramous, and in having a
single eye on its broad anterior front, to the larvæ of most
Entomostracans; but I cannot avoid the belief, that this
resemblance is only apparent, and not essential; and of
false resemblances, how many instances occur in the animal
kingdom! In the larva, when first freed from the egg, both
pairs of antennæ are in process of formation within envelopes:
the mouth is probosciformed and capable of movement,
but is destitute of gnathites; it occupies a position
between the three pairs of natatory limbs; and these limbs
I must believe, for reasons hereafter to be assigned,
answer (improbable as I am well aware it must at first
appear) to the second, third, and fourth thoracic legs of the
archetype Crustacean: the two hinder pairs of limbs apparently
soon become captorial, or fitted to secure prey. Now,
I cannot find in the published accounts of the larvæ of
Entomostracans, any that answer to this description.</p>

<p>The larva in the last stage might be included in the
vast class of Entomostracans: the attachment of the eyes
to the singular apodemes produced inwards from the basal
segment of the great prehensile antennæ, and the development
of only the posterior six pairs of thoracic limbs, are its
chief peculiarities: but its rudimentary mouth, owing to its
transitional or pupal condition, renders the assignment of
its proper rank difficult.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having now given this short comparative sketch of the
structure of a Cirripede, I may venture to express strongly
my opinion, that the group is formed on a distinct type; as
different from the other three or four main Crustacean
groups, namely, the Podophthalmia, Edriophthalmia,
Branchiopoda, and Entomostraca, as these differ from each
other; the differences, moreover, being of the kind considered
by the highest authorities on this subject, as the
most important. It should be observed that there is no
special blending at either end of the Cirripedial series,
towards any one of the other main groups of Crustacea;
it is hardly possible to take some one Cirripede, and say<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" href="#Page_17"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span></a>
that it leads, more plainly than some other Cirripede, into
ordinary Crustaceans. Moreover, a great range of structure,
as we shall soon briefly show, is included within the group:
I can adduce three or four undoubted Cirripedes, very
considerably more different from each other, than any two
members within the sub-class Podophthalmia, or within the
Edriophthalmia, or the Branchiopoda, and quite as different
as within the Entomostraca.</p>

<p>The opinion here expressed, that Cirripedes form a
sub-class of equal value with the other main Crustacean
groups, I am well pleased to find, accords with Mr. Dana's<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[13]</span></a>
view, who remarks that this sub-class "has so many
peculiarities of structure, that it should be regarded as
a distinct type, rather than a subordinate division of the
third (or Entomostracan) type." M. Milne Edwards,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[14]</span></a>
after dividing all Crustacea into two groups, divides one
of them into four legions; and of one of these, the
Entomostraca, he makes the Cirripedes a sub-group. I
feel so entire a deference for any opinion on affinities or
classification expressed by Milne Edwards, that I differ
from him with the greatest hesitation. He does not give
his reasons for assigning so subordinate a rank to Cirripedes,
but I imagine it is from the nature of their metamorphoses:
but if this be the case, I cannot understand why he should
assign to his Branchiopods a rank equal to his Entomostracans.
Moreover, I must repeat, that I do not
believe that the larvæ do resemble the larvæ of Entomostracans
and Branchiopods nearly so closely as at first
appears to be the case. I may add, that Burmeister<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[15]</span></a>
has assigned to the Cirripedes a place amongst the
Crustacea, almost equally subordinate to that given to them
by Milne Edwards.</p>

<p>That Cirripedes have some special affinity to the Entomostraca,
may be inferred from the fewness of the cephalic
appendages, the biramous legs, the state of the abdomen,
and the form of the carapace. Perhaps in the peculiar
state of confluence of the lower segments of the gnathites,<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" href="#Page_18"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span></a>
in the aborted antennæ, the rudimentary eyes, and in the
minute parasitic males (when such exist), there is a more
direct relation to the Suctorial division of the Entomostraca;
but some of these resemblances are probably only analogical,
resulting from the fixed condition of both groups. It should
not be overlooked, that out of the three orders into which
Cirripedes may be divided, in the two latter, the mature
animal presents hardly any resemblance to an Entomostracan.
From the distinct presence in either pupa or mature
animal of the fourteen segments of the cephalo-thorax; from
the apparent composition of the carapace, as will be subsequently
explained; and from the concentrated condition of
the nervous system, one is led to glance at the higher Crustacea;
and here we shall find amongst the Podophthalmia, one
aberrant group of low organisation, namely, that including
Phyllosoma, Amphion, &amp;c., in which more points of resemblance
to Cirripedes may be detected, than, as I believe, in
any other group whatever; for we here see that remarkable
elongation of the head in front of the mouth, so eminently
characteristic of Cirripedes; we have a carapace overlapping
the thorax, which is sometimes free beneath; we have the
abdomen sometimes almost obsolete; we have biramous
legs: and especially we have the posterior cephalic and the
first thoracic appendages more or less rudimentary and obsolete;
and this, I infer from Mr. Dana, is a very rare phenomenon,
though characteristic of all <em>ordinary</em> Cirripedes, in
which the seventh and eighth segments with their appendages
have disappeared. In the order including Phyllosoma,
&amp;c., namely, in the Macroura, the ganglions which
give nerves to the five posterior thoracic limbs, are distinct
from the great sub-œsophageal ganglion which supplies
the several anterior appendages; this is the case with those
Cirripedes in which all the infra-œsophageal ganglions
are not concentrated into one. In the Macroura and
Brachyoura, the first pair of legs almost always differs
in structure from the others, so does the homologous or
second cirrus in Cirripedes differ from the four succeeding
pairs; in some few Macroura, the second leg is antenniformed,
so in some few cases is the homologous (or third)
cirrus; J. Vaughan Thompson was even struck by the<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" href="#Page_19"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span></a>
resemblance in the curious, doubly pectinated spines on the
anterior limbs of Mysis (allied to Phyllosoma<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[16]</span></a>), and on
those of many Cirripedes: these several latter resemblances
may be small, but certainly I do not believe that they are
accidental. Now the little group of Crustaceans, which
includes Phyllosoma, &amp;c., has lately been placed, by
Milne Edwards, as a satellite amongst the Macrourous
Podophthalmia; it leads into the Stomopoda, and likewise,
as has been noticed by many authors, into the sub-class
Branchiopoda, which latter sub-class is considered by Mr.
Dana as only a part of the Entomostraca; this group, therefore,
exhibits affinities radiating in several directions, and
amongst these lines of relationship, one more must, I believe,
be added, plainly directed towards the Cirripedia.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> M. Martin St. Ange ('Mémoire sur l'Organ. des Cirripèdes,' 1835, extrait
des 'Savans Etrangers,' tom. vi) has compared the mouth of Lepas with that of
Phyllosoma, and has given comparative figures; but the resemblance is founded,
I believe, on quite false homologies.</p></div>

<p>One naturally wishes to ascertain how far Cirripedia
are highly or lowly organised and developed; but in all
cases this, as it seems to me, is a very obscure enquiry.
Mr. Dana considers that, in Crustacea, the greater or less
centralisation of all the appendages round the mouth is the
main sign of high development; on this view, the anterior
part of a Cirripede, from being so much elongated, must
be considered as very low in the scale; the whole posterior
part of the body, on the other hand, is, in ordinary Cirripedes,
brought close to the mouth; but this is effected by
the abortion of the seventh and eighth segments of the
cephalo-thorax and of the whole abdomen, and so, I presume,
would not, in Mr. Dana's estimation, raise the class much
in the scale. Von Baer<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[17]</span></a> considers that the perfection of the
type of any animal is in relation to the amount of "morphological
differentiation" which it has undergone; on this view,
Cirripedes ought to stand high in the scale, for they differ
much morphologically from the type of the class to which
they belong; as indeed is shown by the long time that elapsed
before their true position, namely amongst the Crustacea, was
even suspected; but something more must, I think, be added<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" href="#Page_20"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span></a>
to Von Baer's definition; for, to take as an example the eyes
of a Cirripede,—as seen in the first larval stage, there is only
one eye, and that most simple; in the pupa there are two, both
compound, and furnished with complicated muscles; lastly,
in the mature animal there are still two, but of very
minute size, often almost confluent, and of the simplest
structure; hence, then, there has been much morphological
differentiation, but it is almost a contradiction in terms to
speak, in relation to such a case, of <em>perfection</em> of type; and
what has happened to one organ, might happen to other
organs, and so to the whole animal. Lastly, under a physiological
point of view, and taking the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> as the
most perfect type of the class, the sub-œsophageal portion
of the nervous system is highly concentrated; the organs of
sense, excepting the eyes, seem more largely developed than
in ordinary Crustaceans; the circulating system is of the
simplest kind, being only lacunal; special Branchiæ, however,
are developed by the metamorphosis of, as I believe,
a special organ, occurring only in the Lepadidæ; the digestive
organs are very simple, from not having any distinct
liver; the generative system is very low, for both sexes are
generally united in the same individual; and the testes and
ovaria closely resemble each other. On the other hand,
the thoracic limbs are, to a considerable extent, specialised
in their structure and functions; only the three posterior
pairs strictly resembling each other. Lastly, the dermal
and muscular systems are complicated, and not, to use
Professor Owen's term, by mere vegetative repetition, as
will be obvious to any one who will study the beautifully
constructed and modified carapace—that is the operculum,
shell and basis—of a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. On the whole, I look at a
Cirripede as a being of a low type, which has undergone
much morphological differentiation, and which has, in some
few lines of structure, arrived at considerable perfection,—meaning,
by the terms perfection and lowness, some vague
resemblance to animals universally considered of a higher
rank.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> English Translation, in 'Scientific Memoirs,' 1853, vol. i, p. 228.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has been seen that I divide the Cirripedia into three
orders,—the <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>, <a href="#Order_Abdominalia">Abdominalia</a>, and <a href="#Order_Apoda">Apoda</a>; between<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" href="#Page_21"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span></a>
which the fundamental difference consists in the limbs or
cirri being thoracic in the first, abdominal in the second;
and entirely absent in the third. For the sake of showing
the range of character in Cirripedes, to which allusion has
been made, I will briefly indicate the leading differences in
each order. In the <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>, three families are included,—the
<a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, or sessile Cirripedes, the <a href="#Family_Verrucidae">Verrucidæ</a>, remarkable
from their quite asymmetrical shell, and the Lepadidæ,
or pedunculated Cirripedes. The great difference in
external appearance between these three families is known
to all naturalists. Even within the one family of Lepadidæ
there are great differences in external appearance, as
will be admitted on comparison of Lepas, Pollicipes, Conchoderma,
&amp;c.; but we have also important internal differences,
as in the case of Anelasma, in which the cirri are barely
articulated, and are not capable of seizing prey, whilst the
mouth is almost probosciformed, with the outer maxillæ and
palpi rudimentary: still more important are the differences
in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, in which the cirri of the first pair act as brushes;
the second, third, and fourth pairs being quite aborted; and
the fifth and sixth pairs consist only of four segments,
with one of the two normal rami converted into a crenated,
button-like projection, for the sake apparently of triturating
food; <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, also, is very remarkable in being destitute of
a rectum and anus. In this same genus <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, in Ibla
and Scalpellum, there are either separate males or Complemental
males, some of which are so utterly abnormal in
their characters, that by no definition which I could frame,
could they be included even in their proper Order, much
less in their proper Family.</p>

<p>In the second order of <a href="#Order_Abdominalia">Abdominalia</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_707">23</a> and <a href="#Page_708">24</a>)
the seventh or last cephalic segment is quite distinct, and
bears rudimentary organs, answering to the first pair of
maxillipeds of ordinary Crustaceans, of which organs, and of
the segment supporting them, there is no trace in the <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>:
the seven succeeding thoracic segments are destitute
of any appendages; but the three segments of the abdomen
bear three pairs of cirri. The mouth is peculiar in the labrum
being developed into very large, moveable, lancet-formed
organ; and the lower end of the œsophagus is armed with<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" href="#Page_22"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span></a>
beautiful discs of teeth, and brushes of hairs,—a structure
confined to this order. The male resembles the male of
<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>; and the latter genus seems to be the connecting
link between the <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a> and <a href="#Order_Abdominalia">Abdominalia</a>. But the
most important character of this latter order, in which it
differs from <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and all other known Cirripedes, is in
its metamorphoses; all the first changes are merely indicated
by changes in form in an egg-like larva, without the development
of distinct organs; and the last, or pupal condition,
which is attained within the sack of the parent, is very
peculiar, by the entire absence of natatory limbs.</p>

<p>The third order of <a href="#Order_Apoda">Apoda</a> is the most peculiar of all; it contains,
like the last, only one known species: the most acute
naturalist, I am convinced, if he had not made the class his
special study, would never even have suspected that this
animal was a Cirripede. We see much magnified in Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>,
fig. <a href="#p25f07">7</a> a naked, plainly-articulated animal, resembling the
larva or maggot of a fly, attached by two threads; and these
threads, on analysis, can be clearly shown to be the last rudiment
of the carapace, specially modified. The last cephalic,
the seven thoracic, and the three abdominal segments, are
all equally destitute of appendages. The mouth is suctorial,
and constructed on a plan unlike, I believe, anything known
in the articulate kingdom; for the mandibles and maxillæ
have rotated on their axes, and stand back to back; they
can act only by tearing open a slit, and this action is performed
in a hood, formed by the confluence of the broad
palpi and labrum. Although the œsophagus is distinct,
there is no stomach or anus. Lastly, owing to there being
no carapace, the ova are developed, differently from in all
other Cirripedes, within the thorax.</p>

<p>I will close this preliminary discussion on the confines
and type of the sub-class, by recalling attention, now that a
sketch has been given of the three Orders, to the remark
before made, that a wide range of structure is included
within it, and by reurging that the Cirripedia should be
ranked, not as one of the subordinate groups, but as one
of the main divisions of the Crustacea.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Sexual_Relation" id="Sexual_Relation" /><i>On the Sexual Relation of Cirripedes.</i></h3>

<p>Cirripedes are commonly bisexual or hermaphrodite, but
in Ibla, Scalpellum, and <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, members of the Lepadidæ
in the order <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>, and in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> in the order
<a href="#Order_Abdominalia">Abdominalia</a>, the sexes are separate. As two of these
genera were described in my former volume, and two others
(<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> and <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>) are described in this volume, I
may as well here give a brief summary of the facts as yet
known on this very curious subject. The Males, in the
above four genera, present a wonderful range of structure;
they are attached in the usual way by cement proceeding
from the not-moulted antennæ of the pupa, to different
parts, in the different species, of the female. These males are
minute, often exceedingly minute, and consequently generally
more than one is attached to a single female; and I
have seen as many as fourteen adhering on one female!
In several species the males are short-lived, for they
cannot feed, being destitute of a mouth and stomach. As
the females are longer lived, successive crops of males, at
each period of propagation, become attached to her. It is
the females in the above genera which retain the characters
of the genus, family, and order to which they belong; the
males often departing widely from the normal type. Some
of the males are rudimentary to a degree, which I believe
can hardly be equalled in the whole animal kingdom; they
may, in fact, be said to exist as mere bags of spermatozoa.
So widely do some of them depart in every character from
their class, that twice it has happened to me to examine
specimens with a little care, and not even to <em>suspect</em>, until a
long period afterwards, that these males were Cirripedes.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[18]</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> In my volume on the Lepadidæ (p. 200) in searching for analogies for
the permanently epizoic and rudimentary condition of the male Cirripedes, I quoted
two cases, which I believe are now known not to be analogous; namely, the
<i>Syngamus trachealis</i> of Von Siebold, and the worm-like Hectocotyle, which
latter was quite lately supposed to be a male Cephalopod, but has now been
ascertained to be only one of the arms of the male wonderfully adapted and
organised as a sperm-receptacle. The Asplanchna, the mouthless male of a Rotifer,
(p. 292) alone remains for me.</p>

<p><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" href="#Page_24"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span></a></p></div>

<p>In <i>Scalpellum Peronii</i>, and <i>villosum</i>, the males are but little
abnormal, for if classified independently of their sexual
relations, they would be considered as immature specimens
of a new genus, standing next to Scalpellum; in
<i>Scalpellum rostratum</i>, the male would form another and
rather more distinct genus. The males, in the latter,
are attached to the other sex, between the basal edge
of the labrum and the adductor scutorum muscle; but in
<i>S. Peronii</i> and <i>villosum</i> they are attached lower down, in
the furrow between the two scuta, and are thus protected:
in these three species, the internal parts of the male present
nothing particular. In Ibla, the males are attached low
down within the sack of the female; they may be said to
consist of a mouth surmounted on a long peduncle, for
there is no capitulum or general covering, and the whole
thorax is in a rudimentary condition, the cirri being reduced
to two distorted pairs. As these males certainly moult
several times and grow a little, they must feed; and as they
have no cirri fit for action, they must seize their food by
the contortions of their peduncle, which we know homologically
consists of the three first segments of the head.
The movements of the peduncle must, also, supply those of
the probosciformed penis, almost invariably present with
other Cirripedes, but here absent. If compelled to class
these males without regard to the female, great difficulty
would be experienced; we could hardly place in the family
of the Lepadidæ, a Cirripede without a capitulum, and
without cirri, those very organs which give their name to the
class, and with a thorax reduced to the dimensions of a lower
lip; yet, if the presence of a peduncle did determine the
classifier to place these males amongst the Lepadidæ, then
undoubtedly the character of the mouth, &amp;c. would fix their
position next to Ibla.</p>

<p>The males of <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>, <i>ornatum</i>, and <i>rutilum</i>,
resemble each other in all essential points, and differ wonderfully
in appearance and structure from all ordinary Cirripedes.
They consist of a minute flattened bag with a
small orifice at the summit, and at the lower end attached
by the cemented pupal antennæ. On each side of the orifice,
there is a pair of calcareous beads, representing the two<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" href="#Page_25"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span></a>
scuta and two terga of ordinary Cirripedes; and between the
scuta a minute black eye is generally conspicuous. In
<i>S. ornatum</i> the beads, I may remark, on the two sides are
not equal; those either on the right or on the left side,
being larger than those on the opposite side, so that the
animal externally is asymmetrical. Inside, within a tubular
sack, the thorax is lodged, supporting four (instead of six) pairs
of limbs; and these, instead of forming biramous, multiarticulated,
captorial cirri, are reduced to almost a rudiment, supporting
a few long sharp spines, which apparently act only as
defensive organs. At the end of the thorax there is seated a
large abdominal lobe, which does not occur in the other
sex. Hence the thorax, though rudimental, has been specially
modified. Of the mouth and stomach there is not
a vestige. Constructed as these males are, assuredly they
have no claim to be ranked amongst the Lepadidæ or
pedunculated Cirripedes; nor is it possible to class them in
any group whatever of ordinary Cirripedes. In <i>S. vulgare</i>
the males are attached, often several together, to the extreme
edges of the two scuta, and therefore immediately over the
orifice leading into the sack; in <i>S. rutilum</i> and <i>ornatum</i>, they
are attached in concavities on the under side of both scuta,
just above the depression for the adductor scutorum muscle.
In the former of these species, the pit for the reception of the
male is formed by shelly matter not having been deposited
over a certain space on the under side of the valve; and
the pit is converted by a covering of membrane into a
pouch. As there are two scuta so there are two pouches,
in each of which a male is lodged; hence, according to the
Linnean nomenclature, <i>Scalpellum ornatum</i> may be said to
belong to Diandria monogynia. As these males, from
being mouthless, soon die, they are succeeded by successive
pairs; the pupa being led by a wonderful instinct to crawl
into the pouch, and there undergo its metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Lastly, the males of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> and <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_707">23</a>,
fig. <a href="#p23f19">19</a>, and Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f19">19</a>) are remarkable for their similarity
to each other, considering the essential dissimilarity
of the two females. The females live in cavities which
they excavate in the shells of Molluscs, and within which
they are attached by a horny disc; this disc is the only part<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" href="#Page_26"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span></a>
of the outer integument which is not frequently moulted,
and, apparently in consequence, the males are attached to
its edges. It results from this position, that the males
are protected by being enclosed within the cavity excavated
by the female; and it further results, that the
males are attached at a considerable distance from the
orifice of the sack of the female, into which the spermatozoa
have to be conveyed; and to effect this, the probosciformed
penis is wonderfully developed, so that in
<a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, when fully extended, it must equal between
eight and nine times the entire length of the animal!
These males, like those last mentioned of Scalpellum,
consist of a mere bag, lined by a few muscles, enclosing an
eye, and attached at the lower end by the pupal antennæ;
it has an orifice at its upper end, and within it there lies
coiled up, like a great worm, the probosciformed penis,
and beneath it a single testis, with a single vesicula seminalis.
These organs complete the whole organisation of the
male; for there is no mouth, no stomach, no thorax, no
abdomen, and no appendages or limbs of any kind. Yet
all these parts are present in the female. I know of no
other instance in the animal kingdom of such an amount of
abortion. The whole exterior of these males evidently
is composed, as in all ordinary Cirripedes, of the three first
cephalic segments; of the fourteen succeeding segments of
the archetype Cirripede we have not a vestige, excepting
the probosciformed penis, which, from analogy, should arise
from the ventral apex of the seventeenth segment, the first
three segments of the head being counted in the seventeen.
Here, then, fourteen out of seventeen segments have aborted,
the tip of the seventeenth having coalesced with the third
cephalic segment! I am tempted just to notice the case of
<a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, in the order <a href="#Order_Apoda">Apoda</a>, as showing, within the
limits of the same sub-class, a wonderful amount and diversity
in abortion; for in <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, the three anterior
cephalic segments are reduced to the merest rudiment,
encasing the cement-ducts, the fourteen succeeding segments
being unusually well developed; whereas in the above described
males, we have just seen the three anterior segments
fully developed, whilst the fourteen succeeding segments<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" href="#Page_27"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span></a>
are lost or have coalesced with the others; so that within the
same sub-class all seventeen segments of the archetype
have almost disappeared.</p>

<p>It may be asked how I know that the several above
described rudimentary epizoons are really the males of the
Cirripedes to which they are attached. Even if the whole
course of the metamorphoses had not been known in three
of the cases, the mere fact of these epizoons being cemented
by the three terminal segments of their peculiar, pupal
antennæ, would have been sufficient to have shown that
they belonged to the class of Cirripedes. In nearly every
case, I was able to demonstrate, and not in one or two but
in many specimens, that these epizoons were males; and as
in several instances the spermatozoa were developed, and
as, notwithstanding, in no instance was there a vestige of ova
or ovaria, it may safely be concluded that they were not
hermaphrodites, and therefore required females of some
kind. If these epizoic Cirripedes had been independent
animals, as they all belong to the same sub-class, and all have
such peculiar habits, it might have been expected that they
would have shown some special affinity towards each other;
but this is not the case; the epizoon of Ibla is more nearly
related to Ibla, and the epizoon of Scalpellum more nearly
related to Scalpellum, than are these epizoons to each other.
If the several epizoons were classed by themselves, they
would be grouped in divisions, corresponding with those of
the Cirripedes on which they are attached, which is just
what might have been expected if these latter were their
females. There are, also, many special relations between
the male epizoons and the Cirripedes to which they are
attached; thus, the mouth of the epizoon of Ibla, is so like
the mouth of Ibla, which is peculiar in several respects,
that I should easily have recognised it as belonging to a
member of that genus. <i>Scalpellum villosum</i> is remarkable
as one out of only two or three members of the whole
Family, which is destitute of caudal appendages, so is its
male epizoon; again, <i>S. villosum</i> is unusually spinose, so is
its male epizoon; on the other hand, <i>Scalpellum ornatum</i>
is remarkably smooth, so is its male epizoon; and I could
give other similar instances. Will it be believed that these<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" href="#Page_28"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span></a>
coincidences are accidental, and that the epizoons have no
special or sexual relation to the Cirripedes to which they
are attached?</p>

<p>One other instance of coincident structure is so important,
that it must, even in this sketch, be noticed; the
prehensile antennæ of the pupa are most important and
complicated organs, and differ in the different genera of
the same family; they are preserved in a functionless
condition throughout life, and in two instances I was able
accurately to compare these organs in the epizoon and in
the Cirripede to which it was attached, and they were
identical in every particular. The full force of the excessive
improbability of this resemblance, and of the above coincidences
in structure, on the supposition of the epizoon
and its support not being sexually related, will hardly be
perceived without referring to the facts given in detail in
my former volume.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the case of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> (and indirectly in
that of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>) the nature of the male epizoon is, I think,
actually demonstrated; for I traced both it and the female
or ordinary form of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, through the same
several larval stages, from the egg, enclosed within the
sack of the female, to the pupa and mature animal.
Moreover, if the male nature and sexual relation to the
supporting Cirripede, be admitted in any one of these
epizoons, then so close is the agreement in habits, and to a
certain extent in structure, in all the foregoing epizoons,
that probably no one admitting one instance would dispute
the others, and further evidence would even be superfluous.
Indeed, had it not been for the following facts, I should
not have brought forward, either here in abstract, or in
other places in detail, so many arguments and so much
evidence.</p>

<p>I have as yet not entered in detail on the sex of the
supporting Cirripede: in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and in one
species of Ibla, I was able to demonstrate in many specimens,
that all the male organs, internal and external, were
entirely absent; and consequently that these Cirripedes were
<em>exclusively</em> female. In <i>Scalpellum ornatum</i>, also, there is no
trace of external male organs (the state of the four dried specimens<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" href="#Page_29"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span></a>
not allowing the internal organs to be examined), and
there cannot be any reasonable doubt that this species
likewise is exclusively female. It should be borne in mind
that the male organs, external and internal, are most easily
discovered, and that in the above cases I had an abundant
supply of excellent specimens. On the other hand, in
<i>Ibla Cumingii</i>, and in four species of Scalpellum, I was
able to demonstrate in the supporting Cirripede the presence
of all the male organs, as well as of the female; and
in the vesiculæ seminales of several specimens, both in the
Ibla and in <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>, spermatozoa were contained;
the male organs, however, not being very amply developed.
These species, consequently, are not exclusively female, but
are hermaphrodite, though having male epizoons attached
to them. This statement, I am well aware, is enough, at
first, to cast a doubt on all that I have said; but let any
one reflect on the evidence, of which I have here given a
summary, and which has been elsewhere given in full, and
I think he must admit that at least those epizoons which
are exclusively male, and which are attached to Cirripedes
exclusively female, are sexually related and form one
species; but if he admit this, he cannot possibly escape
from the conclusion that some of the other epizoons, for
instance that of <i>Ibla quadrivalvis</i>, are the males of the
hermaphrodites to which they are attached,—these epizoons
not exclusively impregnating the ova of a female, but aiding
the self-impregnation of an hermaphrodite. Hence I have
called these males <i>Complemental Males</i>, to show that they
do not pair with a female, but with a bisexual individual.
Nothing strictly analogous is known in the animal kingdom,
but amongst plants, in the Linnean class, Polygamia,
closely similar instances abound.</p>

<p>In the series of facts now given, we have one curious illustration
more to the many already known, how gradually
nature changes from one condition to the other,—in this
case from bisexuality to unisexuality. Finally, in the four
genera so often named, we meet the following several
cases, some of them even the most diverse, occurring in
closely allied species. (1st), a female, with a single male
(rarely with two) permanently attached to her, protected<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" href="#Page_30"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span></a>
by her, and capable of seizing, by the movements of
its pedunculated body, any minute animals or substances
found within her sack; (2d), a female with successive pairs
of short-lived, mouthless males, inhabiting pouches on each
side under her scutal valves; (3d), a female with many, in
one instance fourteen, short-lived males, destitute of mouth,
thorax, and appendages, but furnished with a stupendously
long male organ, attached to a thickened portion of her
outer integuments, but lying within the cavity which she
has excavated; (4th), an hermaphrodite with a male attached
within the sack, capable of feeding itself, as in the first
case; (5th), an hermaphrodite with from one to three
males, organised like ordinary Cirripedes, and apparently
capable of seizing prey in the common way; and attached
between the scuta, and thus protected; (6th and lastly),
an hermaphrodite with from one or two up to five or six,
short-lived, mouthless males, like those in the second case,
attached in one particular spot, on each side of the orifice
leading into the sack.</p>

<p class="p2">In the sketch of the three Orders given in the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>,
it will have been seen that the differences in their
structure are so great, that it would have been hardly possible
to have given a single blended account of the whole
Class. But as all common Cirripedes are included in the
present Order, here would have been the natural place for
a full description of their external and internal structure.
Having, however, been necessarily, yet perhaps unfortunately,<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" href="#Page_31"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span></a>
led to give, in my former volume, a description of
this kind of the Lepadidæ; and as it is necessary to give a
similar account of the other great family of the Order,
namely, the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, I have found it more convenient
to make this latter account comparative and supplemental
to the former one on the Lepadidæ, and so serve for
the Order, rather than attempt to give a separate description
in full of it. For this latter plan would have involved
much useless repetition, as, on account of the many
exceptions and limitations necessary to almost every statement,
there is little choice between a description of great
length and a mere diagnostic character of the Order, such
as I have given above.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a> may be divided into three very natural
Families, of nearly equal value; firstly, the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, or
sessile Cirripedes, which may be subdivided into two sub-families,
also very natural, the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> and <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>;
secondly, the <a href="#Family_Verrucidae">Verrucidæ</a>, containing only one genus; and
thirdly, the Lepadidæ, or pedunculated Cirripedes. These
three families differ from each other, besides in mere external
appearance, almost exclusively in the relation of the different
portions of their external covering or carapace, and of
the muscles moving such portions. In the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, the
four opercular valves surrounding the orifice leading into
the sack, are capable of other movements, besides being
opened and shut; whereas all the other valves are immoveably
united together. In the Lepadidæ, the valves answering
to the opercular valves, are furnished with a muscle
only for shutting them; whereas the peduncle answering to
the basis in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> is capable of various movements.
In the <a href="#Family_Verrucidae">Verrucidæ</a> the shell is singularly asymmetrical; only
half of the operculum (either the right or the left side, this
varying even in the same species) being moveable; the
other half being immoveably united to the remaining valves;
and the whole shell has only one muscle serving to shut the
moveable half of the operculum. All the internal parts
and organs are very similar in the above three Families.
If, however, the internal structure of one of the two sub-families,
into which the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> may be divided, namely,
of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, be compared with that of the Lepadidæ,<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" href="#Page_32"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span></a>
several important differences may be detected;—on the one
hand, in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, the presence of branchiæ, the extremely
complicated cementing apparatus, the difference in
structure between the third and succeeding pairs of cirri,
the large palpi, the notched labrum, and the laterally double
teeth of the mandibles;—and on the other hand, in the
Lepadidæ, the presence of ovigerous fræna, caudal appendages,
bullate labrum, and often prominent olfactory orifices.
But if the Lepadidæ be compared in these several respects
with the other sub-family, or <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, which cannot
possibly be removed out of the family of <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, many of
these differences break down and disappear, in some or all
of the species.</p>

<p>The Lepadidæ include, as has previously been noticed, a
much greater range of difference than the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>; and
this is what might have been expected, for it is the most
ancient family, and extinction has done its work, separating
genera, which, in accordance to analogy, we may suppose
were once more nearly connected by intermediate forms.
The Lepadidæ, in one sense, may be taken as the type of
their order; for they have undergone less "morphological
differentiation;" that is, they differ the least from the last larval
stage, and seem to give the most <em>general</em> idea of a Thoracic
Cirripede. On the other hand, if we mean, as some authors
do, by the word type, that form which, in the group in question,
has been most modified, and illustrates every peculiarity
of its class in the strongest manner, then we must
look to the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, and to its typical genus, <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>,
for the most Cirripedial form. In this genus the different
portions of the carapace differ most, and subserve to a certain
extent different ends, and in minute structure are
most complicated; here the cementing apparatus, which
offers the main characteristic of the whole sub-class, is most
complex; here the several pairs of cirri differ most from
each other in structure and action; here the peculiar
branchiæ (organs apparently derived from the modification
of another organ, itself confined to Cirripedes, viz., the ovigerous
fræna) are best developed; here the nervous system
is most highly concentrated; and, lastly, here we meet with
the largest and most massive species of the whole group.</p>

<p>Almost every one who has walked over a rocky shore
knows that a barnacle or acorn-shell is an irregular cone,
formed generally of six compartments, with an orifice at
the top, closed by a neatly-fitted, moveable lid, or operculum.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[19]</span></a>
Within this shell the animal's body is lodged; and
through a slit in the lid, it has the power of protruding six
pairs of articulated cirri or legs, and of securing by their
means any prey brought by the waters within their reach.
The basis is firmly cemented to the surface of attachment.
The whole shell, basis, and operculum consists, as we have

the shell is situated in the centre of the basis, where indeed,
by due care, the antennæ of the pupa may be always detected;

<p>When the shell of a sessile Cirripede or barnacle, for
instance, of a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, is first examined, the structure appears
extremely complicated; but this can hardly be considered
as really the case. The structure will, I think, be
best understood by recalling to mind that of Pollicipes,—the
oldest known genus, from which, in one sense, all ordinary
Cirripedes, both sessile and pedunculated, seem to
radiate. I must premise, and the fact in itself deserves
early notice, that the homologies of the several parts in the
pedunculated and sessile Cirripedes admits of no doubt,—that
is, if amongst the pedunculated, the genus Pollicipes,
or certain species of Scalpellum, be taken as a standard of
comparison.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[20]</span></a> The peduncle corresponds with the basis, as
may be clearly seen, if a Pollicipes with a short peduncle,
and a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, with a deep cup-formed or cylindrical basis
be compared, for the contained parts are similar, and both
grow at their upper edges upwards and outwards. Secondly,
the valves round the lower part of the capitulum of a Pollicipes,
though generally much more numerous, and forming
more than one whorl or circle, and not so closely packed
together, answer to the compartments forming the shell of
a sessile Cirripede; this is shown by their lateral and downward
growth, by their upper ends generally projecting freely
above the cavity in which the animal's body is lodged; and
in the case <i>Pollicipes mitella</i>, by an actual resemblance in
outline, some being triangular, some broad at the upper
end, and some sub-rhomboidal, and, lastly, in the manner
in which they slightly overlap and indent each other: moreover
further resemblances in the relative position and even
in the size of the several valves, will hereafter be pointed
out between certain sessile genera amongst the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" href="#Page_35"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span></a>
and certain genera of the Lepadidæ. Thirdly, the scuta and
terga in Pollicipes, so strikingly resemble in manner of
growth in position relatively to the animal's body—in
shape—and even in being articulated together, the valves
which form the operculum or lid of sessile Cirripedes, that
their identity is at once obvious.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Dr. J. E. Gray long ago observed these homologies. If Lepas be taken,
the comparison is not quite so simple, owing to the growth of all the valves in
that genus being upwards; but in several species of Scalpellum we may see the
intermediate steps between the normal downward growth of the valves in
Pollicipes, and the abnormal upward growth in Lepas.</p></div>

<p>It may be well here further to premise, that apparently
none of the sutures in the shells of Cirripedes correspond
with the articulations between the three archetype cephalic
segments, of which the whole shell is formed; or with the
eight elemental pieces, of which each separate segment in the
archetype crustacean is known to consist. But, as I believe,
the several valves in the shell of a Cirripede are homologous,
or at least analogous, with the sclerodermic plates,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[21]</span></a>
of which the carapace of the Podophthalmia is formed;
with this difference, that in the latter they become, after
their first formation, united together into a single piece,
and are thus moulted as a whole; whereas in Cirripedes,
the valves or sclerodermic plates are not moulted, but
continue to be added to throughout life.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Milne Edwards, 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles,' tom. xviii, (1852),
p. 236.</p></div>

<p>In Pollicipes, there is no difficulty in understanding the
growth of the lower valves of the capitulum, especially if a
species be taken in which these valves stand a little way
apart: at each period of growth, they are added to at their
basal edges and a little way up both sides; at the same
time, a new membrane connecting them together is formed,
the old membrane disintegrating, or being left hanging in
tatters to the last zone of growth. Now if we look at
the shell of a sessile Cirripede, there is no essential
difference in the growth of the compartments or valves; all
grow downwards and laterally; but they overlap each other
much more laterally than in Pollicipes, and the connecting
membrane is in most parts reduced to a mere film jammed
in between the valves; but, in the case of the opercular membrane,
it still remains wide, and is periodically moulted.</p>

<p>In the annexed woodcut (fig. <a href="#wof01">1</a>), of the rostrum of
<a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>Balanus Hameri</i></a>, the downward growth and the lateral<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" href="#Page_36"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span></a>
growth on both sides is plain. The modified sides (<i>rr</i>) for
convenience sake, have been called the <i>radii</i>; they invariably
overlap the adjoining compartments. The middle part
(<i>p</i>), has been called the wall, or parietal portion: in the
specimen figured, the walls and radii are distinctly separated,
but in some cases, especially amongst the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, the
lines of growth are absolutely continuous from one to the
other. In fig. <a href="#wof02">2</a> of a Lateral compartment of the same
Balanus, we have the same essential structure; but the left
side (<i>a</i>) is more protuberant, and is hollowed out in its
lower half; it is, also, more distinctly separated from
the parietal portion: this side has for convenience been
called the <i>ala</i>; it is invariably overlapped by the adjoining
compartment: in some few cases, as in <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, the
ala is not hollowed out in its lower part, and from being
added to in a straight line along its whole edge, with the
lines of growth continuous with those on the wall, it differs
hardly at all in appearance from a radius. Lastly, in
fig. <a href="#wof03">3</a> of the carina, or compartment facing the rostrum, we
have alæ (<i>aa</i>) on both sides; these being, as in all cases,
overlapped by the adjoining compartments.</p>

<p>Now, the compartments in the shell of every sessile
Cirripede, are without exception constructed on the above
three simple patterns. In number, they are 8, 6 or 4, or all
confluent together.</p>

<p>Considering this simplicity in growth and form of the
separated compartments, it seems at first surprising that<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" href="#Page_37"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span></a>
the construction and enlargement of the whole shell in
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, should long have been viewed as a difficulty. But
the radii, from growing against rectangular indentations,
or rather furrows, in the opposed compartments, come to be
set a little inwards; and their external surfaces assume a
very different appearance from the wall-portions of the
compartments, which grow against the surface of attachment.
In different species, the summits of the radii (and
of the alæ) grow either very much more obliquely than
in the species figured, or more squarely—that is, they
extend from tip to tip of the adjoining compartments,
parallel to the basis. In this latter case, and when the
surfaces of the radii differ considerably in appearance from
the walls, as in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a> (Plate <a href="#Page_685">1</a>), I am not
at all surprised that the radii should have been described
as separate elements, and called "areæ interjectæ," or
"compartments of the second order:" for the shell of this
Balanus seems to be composed of six wedges with their
points upwards, namely, the parietal portions of the compartments,
and of six other narrower wedges, the radii, with
their points downwards; and the fact that these latter
wedges consist simply of the sides of the parietal portions,
modified by growing against the adjoining compartments,
is completely masked. I should add, that sometimes the
radii are not developed, which simply means that the overlapping
lateral edges of the compartments have not been
added to during growth.</p>

<p>The alæ are originally developed at the period of the metamorphosis,
as slight lateral protuberances in the upper part
of the compartments; from being overlapped, and therefore
not exposed to external influences, and from growing (as in
the case of the radii) against rectangular indentations or
furrows in the adjoining compartments, they generally
assume an extremely different appearance from the parietes,
and might naturally be thought to have a very different
nature. But the alæ in all cases (as is obvious in <span class="correction" title="In the original book this word was italicized"><a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a></span>)
are nothing but the protuberant lateral edges of the compartments,
rendered thin and modified during growth. In
order that the margins of the alæ should be received in an
indentation, the upper internal surfaces of the walls of the<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" href="#Page_38"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span></a>
recipient compartments are thickened all round, excepting
where they receive the alæ. This thickened, upper, internal
portion of the walls or shell, together with the alæ themselves,
form the part called the sheath. The sheath sometimes
blends insensibly into the lower parts of the compartments,
and then perhaps it would not be thought to be a
distinct element; but often it is abruptly separated by an
overhanging edge (see Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p09f09b">9 <i>b</i></a>; Pl. <a href="#Page_704">20</a>, fig. <a href="#p20f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>;
Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">K′</span>) from the lower part, and then the
sheath greatly complicates the internal appearance, but
not the essential structure of the shell. The sheath acts
beautifully, like an internal hoop, in strengthening the
shell round the orifice, where it is naturally weaker than at
the lower or basal end, where it adheres to the surface of
attachment: in the upper part of the shell, moreover, the
sutures between the compartments do not go straight
through, but owing to the alæ projecting and being overlapped,
are extremely oblique; or the joints, in the language
of carpenters, may be said to be broken.</p>

<p>There is one other point of structure in the shells of the
<a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, more especially of species like <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>,
which adds to their apparent complexity, namely,
that the rim or orifice of the shell formed by the upper ends
of the compartments, projects considerably above the opercular
valves. In a young <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, immediately after the
metamorphosis, the operculum is attached by the opercular
membrane all round to the summits of the compartments,
and there cannot be said to be any orifice to the shell
itself, but only an orifice or slit between the opercular
valves; but during growth, as the compartments are added
to at their basal edges, their upper ends are deserted, and
cease to enclose the sack, within which lies the animal's
body. Hence the upper ends come to project freely, either
quite separately as in some species of Pollicipes, where they
cannot be said to form an orifice; or more or less united
into a ring so as to form an orifice, as in the different species
of <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>. It follows, that to understand the real shape
of a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, or rather of the cavity enclosing the animal's
body, all that part of the shell which projects above the
opercular membrane, may, in imagination, be removed as<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" href="#Page_39"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span></a>
something extraneous, like so many spines; not that I
mean to say that these points of shell are dead; on the
contrary, they are often porose and penetrated by numerous
threads of corium. This upper part of the shell, thus produced
so as to form an orifice, no doubt serves to protect
the less strong and moveable operculum.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p><i>Number and Arrangement of the Compartments.</i>—I have
already stated that the shell, in every one of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>,
consists of eight, six, or four compartments, or of all fused
together into a single piece; and that the compartments
themselves are all constructed on the three simple patterns
of which woodcuts (figs. <a href="#wof01">1</a>, <a href="#wof02">2</a>, <a href="#wof03">3</a>) have been given. They
are arranged in a certain definite order. The type arrangement
is found amongst the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, as might have
been expected, inasmuch as this sub-family is so closely
related to the ancient genera Pollicipes and Scalpellum,
whence all the Thoracic Cirripedia may be said to radiate.
In <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a> (fig. <a href="#wof04">4</a>) the type-arrangement of the compartments,
eight in number, is well shown; the rostrum
and carina resemble each other, and have alæ on both
sides, and therefore are overlapped on both sides: the<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" href="#Page_40"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span></a>
rostro-lateral compartments have radii on both sides, and
therefore overlap the adjoining compartments on both sides;
the lateral and carino-lateral compartments have radii on
their carinal, and alæ on their rostral sides; and therefore
overlap on one side, and are overlapped on the other side.
Now the shell of every other sessile Cirripede differs, I
believe, from that of <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>, only in the fusion together
or abortion of some of the eight normal compartments:
in one genus, however, <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>, outer whorls of
small compartments, arranged like the lower valves in the
capitulum of Pollicipes, are superadded. The genus
<a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> (fig. <a href="#wof05">5</a>) differs from <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a> only in the
carino-lateral compartments being aborted, (as will presently
be discussed), and hence has six compartments.
<a href="#Genus_Chamaesipho">Chamæsipho</a> (fig. <a href="#wof06">6</a>) differs from <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> only in the
rostro-lateral and lateral compartments being fused together;
and hence has only four compartments. In
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> (fig. <a href="#wof07">7</a>) and the whole sub-family of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>,
the rostrum is compounded of the true rostrum, as seen in
the type <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>, and of the two rostro-lateral compartments;
hence this compounded rostrum has radii instead
of alæ on both sides, and there are only six compartments.
<a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> (fig. <a href="#wof08">8</a>) and <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a> differ from <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> only
in having the carino-lateral compartments absent, and probably
aborted; hence there are only four compartments.
Lastly, in <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, all the compartments are blended
together into a single piece.</p>

<p>In Pollicipes, the old type-form of the whole order, and
in Scalpellum, we have four valves, (answering to the operculum),
surrounding the aperture leading into the sack, and
the valves below are arranged in successive whorls, with a
strong tendency to alternation. For, the rostrum alternates
with, that is faces the interval between, the two scuta;
the carina alternates with the two terga; and the upper
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: Lateral">lateral</span> valves alternate with the scutum and tergum on
each side. These four valves, namely, the carina and
rostrum, which resemble each other in structure, and the
pair of upper latera, which are larger than the other lateral
valves, together form the uppermost whorl, or that beneath
the scuta and terga. In the next whorl we have the<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" href="#Page_41"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span></a>
rostro- and carino-lateral valves, alternating with those
above them; and beneath them there are generally other
valves, which decrease in size and display the same tendency
to alternation. The valves here just specified, namely, the
rostrum, carina, and three pairs of lateral valves, in the
Lepadidæ, are so much larger, and are so much more
commonly present, than the other valves of the capitulum,
that to them alone I affixed special names. Now if amongst
sessile Cirripedes we look to that genus, viz., <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>,
which comes in its whole structure the nearest to Pollicipes,
one of the Lepadidæ, we find (as in fig. <a href="#wof04">4</a>), firstly, a rostrum
and carina resembling each other, and a pair of lateral compartments,
larger than the other lateral pairs; these four
valves alternating with the opercular valves: and, secondly,
we find, but forming part of the same whorl, a pair of rostro-lateral
and a pair of carino-lateral compartments, which, just
as in Pollicipes, are larger than the exterior and lower valves.
These lower little valves, I may remark, decrease in size in
the successive whorls, and tend to alternate in position, just
as in Pollicipes. Observing these several striking points of
correspondence in the valves, (and indeed in the whole
structure), of <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a> and Pollicipes, one is strongly
inclined to suspect that in <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>, and therefore in
<a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a> and other sessile Cirripedes, although the rostro-
and carino-lateral compartments appear to lie in the same
whorl with the rostrum, carina, and large lateral compartments,
yet that they really belong, as in Pollicipes and
Scalpellum, to a lower whorl. Now if a very young shell
of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, immediately after the metamorphosis, be examined,
the carino-lateral compartments will be found not
to have been developed; they first appear after two or three
zones of growth have been added to the other compartments;
bearing in mind that in Pollicipes and in <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>
the lower whorls are added successively during
growth, we find in this fact strong confirmation of the view
that the carino-lateral compartments normally belong to a
whorl beneath that including the rostrum, carina, and
lateral compartments. Whether the rostro-lateral, like the
carino-lateral compartments, are developed subsequently to
the others, I have had no opportunity of ascertaining, and<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" href="#Page_42"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span></a>
therefore cannot confirm the above analogical conclusion,
namely, that they, also, belong to a lower whorl.</p>

<p>In the sub-family <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, which includes <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>
(woodcut <a href="#wof07">7</a>), and <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> (woodcut <a href="#wof08">8</a>), the shell is characterised
by not having rostro-lateral compartments, and by
the rostrum having radii: now in <a href="#Pachylasma_giganteum"><i>Pachylasma giganteum</i></a>,
which undoubtedly belongs to the sub-family <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>,
at a very early age the rostro-lateral compartments become
blended with the true rostrum, making a compound rostrum,
exactly like the rostrum in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>; distinct
evidence of a similar fusion is retained throughout life
(Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f01">1</a>) in all three species of <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, which is undoubtedly
a member of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>. Hence, I think, we
may conclude that in all the genera of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> the
rostro-lateral compartments are probably not aborted, but are
blended with a normal rostrum (resembling that in woodcuts
<a href="#wof04">4</a>, <a href="#wof05">5</a>, <a href="#wof06">6</a>), making together a compound rostrum furnished
with radii: it must, however, be observed that I could
not detect any actual evidence of this fusion in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>,
even immediately after the metamorphosis. In <a href="#Genus_Chamaesipho">Chamæsipho</a>
(woodcut <a href="#wof06">6</a>), either the rostro-lateral compartments attain a
most unusual breadth, or, as is more probable, they have
become confluent with the lateral compartments, which in the
Lepadidæ seem to be the most persistent of all the lateral
valves. In such genera as <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> and <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, in which
the carino-lateral compartments are absent, they may be
fused with the lateral compartments or with the carina; but
seeing that they are normally developed later than the other
valves, it appears to be the simplest theory to assume, until
the contrary be proved, that they are aborted. Finally, the
somewhat unexpected conclusion that the shell (not including
the operculum) of sessile Cirripedes normally consists of
eight valves, four belonging to an upper whorl, and four
to a lower whorl, all forced into a single ring, and often
more or less fused together, though not strictly proved, is
rendered highly probable. I will only further add, that
the Basis perhaps represents several whorls of the small
valves or scales on the peduncle of Pollicipes, fused together;
the comparison of the basis with the calcareous cup,
forming the lowest portion of the peduncle in Lithotrya,<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" href="#Page_43"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span></a>
which has been made by some authors, I do not think is
very accurate, as the cup in Lithotrya seems to have a

<p>If the basal
margin of a compartment, for instance, of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>,
be examined, it appears
sufficiently complicated, being
composed of an outer and inner
lamina, separated by longitudinal
septa, which are denticulated
at their bases; and the tubes
formed by these longitudinal
septa are crossed by transverse
septa. On the other hand,
in some cases, as in the genera
<a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> and <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>, each compartment consists
of a simple shelly layer. These two extreme states graduate
into each other: we have, firstly, on the internal
surface, quite irregular points and ridges; these become
regular, causing the internal surface to be longitudinally
ribbed; then these ribs themselves become finely furrowed
on their sides and at their lower ends, producing sharp,
minute ridges, the ends of which I have called the denticuli;
and, lastly, some of the denticuli on the adjoining
longitudinal septa become united into a solid layer, forming
the internal lamina of the wall. These denticuli do not
generally cover the whole surface of the longitudinal ribs,
but leave a portion near the outer lamina of the compartment
smooth. The denticulated ends of the longitudinal
septa project beyond the basal edge of both the outer and
inner laminæ, and enter the mouths of the tubes (where
such occur) in the basis, and thus strengthen the shell.
The whole of the internal lamina generally is more or less
striated longitudinally, thus displaying its origin from the
union of the inner edges of the longitudinal septa. I need
only further remark that on the internal surface of the outer
lamina, between the main longitudinal septa, there are
generally (as in the woodcut) smaller longitudinal ridges,
which do not reach the inner lamina, and on this account
alone are not called septa.</p>

<p><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" href="#Page_44"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span></a></p>

<p>Tubes are formed by the longitudinal septa, between the
outer and inner laminæ. These tubes are almost square, and
are occupied by threads of corium, which enter at pores
left open between the edge of the compartment and that of
the basis on which it rests. The tubes extend high up the
compartments; but in the uppermost part they are generally
cut off by thin, transverse, calcareous septa, deposited by
the ends of the threads of corium; a cancellated structure
being thus produced. Or the uppermost part of each tube
becomes filled up solidly with compact shelly layers, which
are always first thrown down on the side of the tube facing
the outside, and thus greatly strengthen the shell: in
several instances, as in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Balanus perforatus</i></a> and <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita
porosa</i></a>, in which the disintegration of the upper part of the
shell is a necessary element in its growth for the enlargement
of the orifice, these filled up tubes become exposed.
In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, the tubes in their upper
parts are, I believe, crossed only by transverse membranous
septa.</p>

<p><i>Anomalies and exceptions.</i>—In <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_694">10</a>, fig. <a href="#p10f01g">1 <i>g</i></a>,
<a href="#p10f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>) from the branching of the longitudinal septa, several irregular
rows of tubes are formed. In certain varieties of
<a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_691">7</a>, fig. <a href="#p07f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>), and in <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a>
(Pl. <a href="#Page_691">7</a>, fig. <a href="#p07f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>), slight branching ridges on the internal
surface of the walls, seem to answer to the longitudinal
septa, and produce, during the downward growth of the
shell, extremely irregular cells, and short tubes. In <a href="#Balanus_vinaceus"><i>Balanus
vinaceus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f07d">7 <i>d</i></a>), the internal lamina, instead of
being solid, as in every other species, is left cancellated, and
thus betrays, much more plainly than usual, its origin in
the united denticuli of the adjoining longitudinal septa. In
<a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>Balanus porcatus</i></a>, between the main longitudinal septa,
there are (Pl. <a href="#Page_690">6</a>, fig. <a href="#p06f04e">4 <i>e</i></a>) what may be called rudimentary
and disconnected longitudinal septa. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and its
allies (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f06">6</a>, and Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>, fig. <a href="#p17f04c">4 <i>c</i></a>) it is the outer
lamina of the compartment which is anomalous; for in the
two or three lower zones of growth, it forms only a
ledge on each side of the longitudinal septa; which ledges,
higher up, become confluent, and so form an ordinary outer
lamina. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, also, the wall of each compartment<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" href="#Page_45"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span></a>
(see transverse section, Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, figs. <a href="#p16f05">5</a>, <a href="#p16f07">7</a>) is very remarkable
from being deeply folded, the folds being on their internal
faces firmly calcified together, and on their external faces
closely pressed together (often with a neatly serrated
suture), so that the whole nature of the shell might be, as
has happened, easily quite misunderstood; and the walls be
considered as very thick, instead of being, as is really the
case, very thin. In <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f01">1</a>), however,
the walls are truly of such great thickness, that the nature
of the relative parts might likewise be misunderstood; in
this genus the ovarian tubes enter the walls, extending up
between the longitudinal septa, or, as they may here
be more naturally called, the radiating septa. I will specify
a few more peculiarities worthy of remark:—in some species
of the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>, clefts are left, covered only by
membrane, on the lines of suture (Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, figs. <a href="#p09f07a">7 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p09f08a">8 <i>a</i></a>), between
the compartments, just above the basis; and in other
species the basis is perforated by numerous membrane-covered,
minute orifices. In <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, each compartment
has one deep inward fold (Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>, <a href="#p17f01a">fig. 1</a>), somewhat analogous
to the three folds in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>; this fold is produced
into an internal midrib, supporting and rendering convex
the membranous basis; in this genus, also, the rostrum,
owing to its <span class="correction" title="In the original book: mid-rib">midrib</span>, is generally thrust a little on one side,
and the shell thus rendered asymmetrical. In <a href="#Chamaesipho_scutelliformis"><i>Chamæsipho
scutelliformis</i></a> the shell is symmetrically perforated (Pl. <a href="#Page_703">19</a>,
fig. <a href="#p19f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>) by four apertures. Lastly, in <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>Chthamalus Hembeli</i></a>
and <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>intertextus</i></a>, after a certain age, the basal edges of the
walls become inflected, and continue to grow inwards
till they entirely take the place of the true membranous
basis.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Structure_of_the_Radii" id="Structure_of_the_Radii" /><span class="correction" title="In the original book this title was in the TOC but not in the text."><i>Structure of the Radii.</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="correction" title="This title was in the original book and could be replaced by the inserted title above. However it is required for the following sentence structure."><i>Radius.</i></span>—This term, as we have seen, is applied to that
side of the compartment, the growth of which is modified,
by abutting against and overlapping the adjoining compartment.
Hence the structure of the radius is essentially the
same with that of the parietal portion of the compartment.
When best developed, as in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>, the radius
consists of an outer and inner lamina, separated by denticulated
septa, extending in horizontal lines parallel to the
basis, and is consequently perforated by minute tubes or<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" href="#Page_46"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span></a>
pores. The tubes become filled up solidly much more
commonly than do the parietal tubes; and the inner
lamina, in such cases, is hardly distinct from the outer
lamina. The denticuli often fail, or are present only on
the lower sides of the septa; and very frequently the edge
of the radius can only be said to be crenated.
Notwithstanding these frequent
anomalies, if a series of species and genera
be taken, it is certain that there is, as
might have been expected, a close relationship
in internal structure, between the
radii and the parietes. The edge of the
radius is received in a slight furrow
(generally marked like a seal, with the
impression of the denticulated septa) in
the opposed compartment: sometimes the
outer edge or lid of the recipient furrow,
is so broad as to give the false appearance
of a radius having been developed, at least in the lower
part of the shell, on both sides of the suture. A crest of
corium runs into each suture between the edge of the
radius and the furrow in the opposed compartment; and
when the radius is permeated by pores (as in woodcut <a href="#wof10">10</a>),
threads of corium branch off this crest, and enter the pores.
In the lower part of the shell, these crests of corium project
from the corium forming and surrounding the sack; but in
the upper part of the shell, above the opercular membrane,
and therefore above the sack, the corium is produced up
each line of suture as a separate ribbon. In proportion as
these ribbons extend more or less near to the summit of
the shell, so do the edges of the radii continue to be added
to, to a greater or less height from the basis; and consequently
their summits become less or more oblique.</p>

<p><i>Peculiarities in the Structure of the Radii.</i>—In some of
the species of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, in which genus the walls consist of
several rows of tubes, the radii are likewise perforated by
several rows; and in some of the other species (Pl. <a href="#Page_694">10</a>,
fig. <a href="#p10f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>), the edge, or disarticulated surface of the radius,
is marked by irregularly branching ridges; and these
evidently correspond with the branching septa or ridges of<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" href="#Page_47"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span></a>
the wall. In <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, the outer lamina of the radius,
as well as of its recipient furrow, is of extraordinary thickness;
and this lamina, in <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p14f05">5</a>, <i>b</i>,
and Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f01">1</a>, <i>f</i>), is modelled into sharp transverse
ridges and valleys. In the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, the radii, like the
parietes, are simply solid; and apparently in consequence,
for the sake of strengthening the sutures, the edges of the
radii, and of the recipient furrow in <span class="correction" title="In the original book this word was italicized."><a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a></span> (Pl. <a href="#Page_704">20</a>,
fig. <a href="#p20f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>) and in <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>Chthamalus dentatus</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>Hembeli</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_702">18</a>,
fig. <a href="#p18f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p18f05a">5 <i>a</i></a>), are neatly dentated. In some other species
of <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_703">19</a>, fig. <a href="#p19f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>), the radii present a slight
modification of this structure, the sutures being formed by
oblique interfolding laminæ. In the radii of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and
<a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, there is a peculiarity, in apparent connection
with the fact, that in these genera the parietal tubes are
not crossed by transverse calcareous septa, namely, that
the pores by which the radii are permeated keep unclosed
throughout their length, and open into a special longitudinal
tube (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>, <i>d′</i>), which runs along that margin of the
wall, whence the radius arises. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> the wall is of
extreme thinness, and in conformity so is the true radius,
but that the shell might not thus be rendered very weak,
complementary or pseudo-radii are developed on their inner
sides (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>, adjoining the true radii <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <i>d</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> <i>d</i>, and
shaded by distant convex lines). Even in the allied genus
<a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, in which the whole shell tends to become
rudimentary, traces of these pseudo-radii (Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>, fig. <a href="#p17f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>, <i>d</i>)
can be detected. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, though the radii (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>,
fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <i>d</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> <i>d</i>) are, by the above special means, rendered
thick, and though the alæ also are thick (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> <i>a′</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> <i>a′</i>), yet
together they do not equal in thickness the folded walls; and
consequently, there is left between the radii and alæ square
chambers (<i>v</i>), occupied by the branching ovarian tubes.</p>

<p>These project, generally abruptly, from the sides
of the upper part of the compartments; they appear from
the first growth of the shell; they are overlapped by the
radius and by part of the wall of the adjoining compartment;
they are thinner, and have, owing apparently to
being overlapped, a very different aspect from the parietal
portion; but they do not differ from it in essential nature.
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" href="#Page_48"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span></a>
They are solid, that is, they are never permeated by pores;
but their edges are generally crenated, and there is, in
some cases, as in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, sufficient evidence that these
crenations answer to the horizontal septa on the edges
of the radii (also often reduced to mere crenations), and
consequently, likewise, to the longitudinal septa of the parietes.
In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> the edge of each ala consists of a
medial ridge, sending off denticulated septa on <em>both</em> sides,
and is therefore anomalous as compared with the alæ in
other genera, but corresponds in structure with the similarly
anomalous radius of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. In order to allow of
the growth of the edge of the ala, a fine thread of corium runs
up the narrow furrow in which the edge is lodged, proceeding
from the corium of the sack. In proportion as this
thread runs up higher or lower, so are the summits of the
alæ rendered, during growth, less or more oblique.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Structure_of_the_Sheath" id="Structure_of_the_Sheath" /><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Sheath."><i>Structure of the Sheath.</i></span></h3>

<p>As the compartments overlap each other, the
edges of the alæ would have projected, and the inner surface
of the orifice of the shell would not have been smooth
and rounded, had not that part of each wall, which does
not overlie an ala, been thickened so as to allow of the
formation of a shoulder or indentation, against which the
edge of the ala fits and abuts. The thickened portions, and
the alæ themselves, together form the sheath, of which the use
seems to be to strengthen, like a broad internal hoop, the
upper part of the shell round the orifice, where naturally it
is weak. The sheath is composed of successive, fine, shelly
layers, which extend, as the shell is added to at the
basal margin, lower and lower down on the inner surface
of the walls. The lower edge of the sheath either simply
projects a little inwards, or more commonly is formed into a
sharp depending ridge, as represented in fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">K′</span>, Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>. In
some species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>), the sheath reaches
nearly to the bases of the compartments; and in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>
(Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f04">4</a> <i>e</i> <i>c</i> <i>e</i>), the inner layer of shell surrounding the
sack, which seems to correspond more nearly to the sheath
than to the inner lamina of the walls, actually rests on the
basal membrane. The opercular membrane is generally,
but not invariably, attached only a little way above the lower
edge of the sheath: at each exuviation, a new opercular<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" href="#Page_49"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span></a>
membrane is formed, and is attached to the next lower zone
of the sheath; the old membrane being cast off, but a
circular slip of it is left, investing the last zone. Hence
the whole upper part of the sheath above the opercular
membrane, comes to be thus invested; and is marked by
circular lines, one above the other, caused by the successive
exuviations. This investing membrane often supports rows
of minute bristles, directed upwards. Generally, a film of
shell is deposited, at the period of the formation of each
new opercular membrane, on that part of the sheath which
lies immediately beneath. This innermost film or thin
layer of shell, on the lines of suture between the compartments,
breaks joint, at least in some cases, with the underlying
shelly layers,—that is, the suture in this last-formed
film does not lie exactly over the suture in the subjacent
layers of the sheath. In <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, the sheath extends
down close to the basis; and what is unique in this one
genus, the opercular membrane, gradually thinning out
downwards, closely adheres to the whole inner surface of
the shell. In <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> and in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>,
fig. <a href="#p17f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>), the sheath separates easily into separate successive
rims of shell; and this structure evidently is for the sake
of facilitating the breakage of the upper end of the shell,
which, as we shall presently see, is necessary to allow of the
increase in size of its orifice.</p>
</div>
<div class="no-section">

<h3 class="center"><a name="Structure_of_the_Basis" id="Structure_of_the_Basis" /><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Basis."><i>Structure of the Basis.</i></span></h3>

<p>This, in several genera and species, is composed
of simple membrane, and consists of successive, concentric,
circular slips, added round the outside, at each period of
growth. In some species of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> and <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> the
basis is calcareous, but diaphanous, very thin, smooth, or
somewhat granulated. In other cases it consists of a single
calcareous lamina, either smooth, or with ridges radiating from
its centre; it is formed of two laminæ, (as is most usual in
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>,) separated by radiating septa. These septa, as well
as the radiating ridges in the case of the single lamina, are
homologous with the longitudinal septa of the parietes.
The denticulated ends of the latter enter the mouths of the
tubes formed by the radiating septa of the basis: threads of
corium pass between the denticuli of the parietal septa, and
thus enter the basal tubes. The ends of these threads of<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" href="#Page_50"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span></a>
corium generally deposit transverse calcareous septa, exactly
as within the parietal tubes. When the basis is thick the
septa themselves (<i>ccc</i>) between the proper basal tubes, become
porose, (or rather cancellated,)
and they sometimes expand into a
very thick, cancellated layer, separating
the outer lamina (<i>a</i>) of the
basis from the proper basal tubes,
which always lie close under the
inner lamina (<i>b</i>). This structure
differs only slightly from that seen
in the parietes of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, in
which the branching of the longitudinal
parietal septa, produces
thick walls, formed of several rows
of tubes or pores. With respect to peculiarities in structure
of the basis, <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>Balanus lævis</i></a> offers the most remarkable case;
for here, in specimens which have grown crowded together,
the whole interior appears sometimes to have become
too much elongated or too deep for the animal's body, and
consequently the lower part of the deeply-concave basis
has been filled up (Pl. <a href="#Page_688">4</a>, fig. <a href="#p04f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>) by thin, irregular, calcareous
diaphragms. In elongated specimens, also, of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus
balanoides</i></a>, the shell sometimes appears to have grown
too long for the animal's body; but in this case the membranous
basis becomes extremely convex inwards; it still
reaches the basal edges of the parietes all round, but in the
middle it is raised high above the surface of attachment; yet
sometimes threads of the cementing tissue depend from the
middle part to the surface of attachment. In <a href="#Balanus_terebratus"><i>Balanus
terebratus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_692">8</a>, fig. <a href="#p08f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p08f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>), and in some species of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>,
the basis is riddled, as previously stated, by numerous,
minute, membrane-covered orifices. In <a href="#Balanus_declivis"><i>B. declivis</i></a> the
membranous basis is always extremely oblique, owing to
the rostral end of the shell being twice as high as the carinal
and opposite end.</p>

their powers of movement, their separation by flexible

truth of this conclusion. The opercular valves are four in
number,—a pair of scuta and a pair of terga; but the latter
in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a> and <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>reginæ</i></a>, are either aborted or represented
by a mere rudiment; and in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> both
scuta and terga are quite absent. In several cases, more
especially in the genus <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), the
scutum and tergum on each side are calcified together, so
that sometimes not even a trace of the line of junction can
be discovered. In most cases the scutum is firmly united,
being articulated in a manner presently to be described, to
the tergum; but in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>, fig. <a href="#p17f03c">3 <i>c</i></a>),
and <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, the ends of these valves are simply approximated.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—These valves are important, inasmuch as the
animal's body is attached to them; in Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, the
broken line, surrounding <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, shows where the body has
been cut, in removing the scutum on the near side, the
other scutum, <span class="smcap lowercase correction" title="In the original book: S">S</span>, being left articulated to the tergum, <span class="smcap lowercase correction" title="In the original book: T">T</span>.
In shape the scuta are generally sub-triangular; but in some
species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a> and in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, &amp;c. they are much
elongated. The lines of growth are usually prominent; and
along the occludent margins the alternate, or sometimes every
third or fourth line, is developed into a knob, which produces
a serrated edge, serving to lock the two opposed valves
together; there is, however, no trace of this structure in
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>. In some species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, a
ledge of considerable breadth (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f03e">3 <i>e</i></a>, &amp;c.) is developed
along the occludent margins of the two scuta, as
well as of the two terga, giving them an anomalous struc<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" href="#Page_52"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span></a>ture.
The <i>Terga</i> differ considerably in outline in the different
genera and species: their shape approaches more nearly
to a triangle than to any other regular form; but there is
generally a projection or spur on the basal margin, on the
side towards the scutum. In some species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, the
tergum is of so irregular a shape as to defy description.
In most cases, a longitudinal depression or furrow runs
down the valve, from the apex to the extremity of the
spur; and it not rarely happens that the sides of this furrow
become folded inwards and almost closed. The spur probably
answers to the basal point of the usually sub-rhomboidal
tergum in Pollicipes and Scalpellum.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[22]</span></a> The tips of
the terga in some species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, &amp;c., are specially
modified into sharp points or beaks (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p02f03d">3 <i>d</i></a>),
bowed a little inwards, and projecting considerably above
the tips of the scuta; this is effected by the medial, uppermost
part of the valve being internally thickened and
hardened, and then, by the disintegration of the two margins
and the external surface, the internal modified portion becomes
exposed. The whole valve, also, at least in such
cases as in <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>Balanus psittacus</i></a>, appears to be forced slowly
upwards in the articular furrow of the scutum. I am
assured, by a competent observer, that the beaks of the
terga in <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a> can give an object placed within the
orifice of the shell a sharp tap.</p>

member of the Lepadidæ, for instance, that of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> with that of Pollicipes,
apex corresponds with apex: the extremity of the spur in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> corresponds
with the basal point of the whole valve in Pollicipes: the scutal margin, (which
in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> homologically extends down to the extremity of the spur), corresponds
with the scutal margin of Pollicipes: the carinal margin in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>
corresponds with the <em>upper</em> carinal margin in Pollicipes: the basal margin of
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> on the carinal side of the spur, corresponds with the <em>lower</em> carinal
margin in Pollicipes: lastly, (and this is the chief difference), in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> there
is no appreciable occludent margin, the apex of the valve being brought close
to the upper angle of the scutal margin; in <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, however, there is
yet left some remnant of an occludent margin,—which margin in Pollicipes is
conspicuous.</p></div>

<p>The scutum and tergum, with the few exceptions above
stated, are articulated together at a large or open angle.
The articulation (see Pl. <a href="#Page_695">11</a>, fig. <a href="#p11f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p11f05c"><i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p11f05d"><i>d</i></a>, and fig. <a href="#p11f06b">6 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p11f06c"><i>c</i></a>) is
effected by the margin of the tergum being a little inflected,
and lodged in a furrow in the margin of the scutum. This<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" href="#Page_53"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span></a>
furrow in the scutum has its further border generally prominent
and often reflexed or curved over; I have called it
the articular ridge; it, also, is lodged in a furrow in the
upper part of the tergum, which again is bordered by a
ridge, viz., the articular tergal ridge. So that in both
scutum and tergum there is an articular furrow, bordered
in each case, on one side by the margin of the valve, and on
the other side by the so-called articular ridge. In <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>
(Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>) the articular ridge of the scutum is horny.
When, as often happens, the scuta and terga have been
much worn, the manner of their articulation (Pl. <a href="#Page_702">18</a>, fig. <a href="#p19f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>)
is pretty well shown even from the outside; in this case
their external appearance is very different from what it is
in those individuals (fig. <a href="#p18f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>) of the same species, which
have not suffered disintegration. This articulation of the
scuta and terga is prefigured amongst the Lepadidæ, in
<i>Pollicipes mitella</i>, and in Lithotrya.</p>

<p>The scuta are brought together by a short, strong,
straight, adductor muscle (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1, <i>a</i></a>); its attachment
leaves (with very few exceptions, as in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>) a
rounded impression, or even pit, on the under side of the
valve in its upper part. This pit is frequently bounded, on
its lower side, by a sharp ridge, which, though not in actual
connexion with the adductor muscle, I have, for convenience
sake, called the adductor ridge; it serves apparently to give
support to the animal's body; in some few cases (as in
<a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f03c">3 <i>c</i></a>) it is confluent at its upper
end with the articular ridge, and converts the whole basi-tergal
corner of the valve into a deep cavity. In some of
the species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_696">12</a>, fig. <a href="#p12f05c">5 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p12f07b">7 <i>b</i></a>), and in some
varieties of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a>, this adductor ridge is enormously developed,
so as to depend far beneath the true basal margin,
or that to which the opercular membrane is attached. At
the basi-tergal corner of the valve, there is generally a small
pit or impression, and sometimes distinct crests, for the
attachment of the lateral depressor muscle. At the rostral
end there is, also, a small cavity formed by the overfolding
of the occludent margin (rarely furnished with crests) for the
attachment of the rostral depressor muscle. In the Terga,
at the basi-carinal corner, there are usually crests, though<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" href="#Page_54"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span></a>
sometimes feebly developed, for the attachment of the tergal
depressor muscle. But in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>,
<a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, and in some other cases, there are no crests.
The crests, when well developed, are furnished with rectangular
sub-crests or denticuli on both sides; in fact they
resemble, and are probably homologous with, the denticulated
ribs or septa in the parietes, radii, and basis. Altogether
the scuta and terga are attached, as far as muscles are concerned,
to the shell and sack, by three longitudinal pairs.</p>

<p>The
opercular valves are added to along their basal
margins alone;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[23]</span></a> the animal's body, together with the
several muscles, becoming attached at each period of growth
lower and lower down to the valves; this no doubt is
effected by the absorption of the upper surfaces of the
muscles, and the formation of new fasciæ on their lower
surfaces. The opercular membrane, which, though thin
and flexible, forms part of the general outer surface of
the animal as much as does any portion of the rigid shell,
with which indeed it is strictly homologous, is periodically
moulted, together with the integuments of the whole included
animal. The new opercular membrane is of course each
time formed a little larger than the old one. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>
and <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, however, several successive opercular
membranes are preserved one over the other, and the outside
membrane gradually disintegrates; in these cases the
undermost opercular membrane is formed wrinkled and
considerably too large, so as to allow of being stretched,
before it is finally cast off. In <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, the opercular
membrane runs down, adhering to the inner surface of the
shell, to nearly the basis, and hence during the diametric
growth of the shell, it is longitudinally split, and is repaired
by slips of new membrane, which resemble the radii in
form and in direction of the lines of growth.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> In some species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, the ledge (<i>limbus occludens</i>) which is added
along the occludent margin of both scuta and terga, and in some species of
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> a narrow rim, or slight protuberance which is added along the carinal
margin of the terga, offer unimportant exceptions to the rule, that the opercular
valves grow only at their basal margins.</p></div>

<p>The basis is added to only round the circumference, and<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" href="#Page_55"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span></a>
hence increases in diameter, and, when concave, in depth.
The compartments grow at their basal margins, where they
are in contact with the basis; hence the shell is added to in
height, and, owing to the outward inclination of the compartments,
also, in basal diameter; but the compartments
likewise, in most cases, grow along both lateral margins,
that is, on the edges of the radii and alæ; and hence the
upper part of the shell, also, increases in diameter. The
orifice of the shell, moreover, thus becomes enlarged. In
some cases the shell is destitute of radii, only sutures being
present, that is, the compartments do not grow laterally; and
sometimes, as in the whole genus <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, there are not even
sutures, the compartments having been fused together: in
both these cases, the shell can increase in diameter only at
the base; and the orifice, it might have been thought, would
necessarily have remained, to the destruction of the animal,
of the same minute size, as when first formed after the
metamorphosis: this certainly would have been the case had
not the upper ends of the compartments, surrounding and
forming the orifice, been nicely adapted always to yield, in
a certain limited degree, to the disintegrating influences to
which every shell is exposed, but which most Cirripedes
can resist; and the disintegration of the narrow end of a
conical tube, of course increases the diameter of its orifice.
In <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, in which the shell is furnished with narrow
radii, and does increase in diameter from top to bottom, the
increase is not sufficient in proportion to the continued
elongation of the shell; to compensate for this, the orifice is
enlarged at short intervals by the breakage of the upper end
of the shell, for which purpose (as explained under the
genus) it is evidently constructed. Hence we see that, in
certain Cirripedes, decay or disintegration, and breakage,
are necessary elements in their growth! It is a remarkable
fact, which I cannot explain, that in some species in which
the orifice of the shell is usually increased by disintegration,
if individuals are so situated that they are not exposed to
sufficiently energetic disintegrating influences, as may be
inferred from the well-preserved condition of the whole
surface of the shell, then the radii become developed, and
the orifice is increased in size by the diametric growth of<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" href="#Page_56"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span></a>
the upper part of the shell: I have seen instances of this in
<a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a>, and <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>purpurascens</i></a>, and in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Balanus perforatus</i></a>:
it appeared, but of course erroneously, as if the
lateral growth of the compartments had been subjected to
the will of the animal.</p>

<p>Considering the strength of the shell of sessile Cirripedes,
the separation of their compartments one from another and
from the basis, during growth, has justly been thought a
surprising circumstance. In most <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a> and in
some species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, however, if the shell be boiled in
caustic potash, the compartments fall apart with a touch;
this shows that their union is due to animal and probably to
organised matter, and the growth of such matter between
the opposed edges of the compartments, and their consequent
gradual separation, offers no particular difficulty.
But in many Balani, boiling in potash for hours does not
seem even to weaken, in the least degree, the sutures, which
are wonderfully strong—the shell often breaking rather than
yield on these lines; if, however, the shell be dissolved in
acid, the animalised tissue which is left easily separates on
the lines of suture, and if this tissue be boiled in potash, the
remnants of the compartments fall quite separate. These
facts seem to me to show, that the compartments in such
cases are joined along the lines of suture by tissue, which
must be in a calcified state, but which, nevertheless, continues
to grow by intersusception; in other words, I believe
that the tips of the complicated ridges and points interlocking
on the lines of suture, are not separated from each
other by films of corium or simple animal matter, but are
actually united by corium in a calcified, yet still growing
condition.</p>

<p>In ordinary Crustaceans, the growth is periodical and
sudden; a new and larger carapace, for instance, is formed
under the old one, and after the exuviation of the latter, the
new one soon hardens, and does not subsequently increase
in size; so it is in the case of Cirripedes, with the membranes
of the body, and even with certain parts, as the opercular
membrane, of the external covering. But a Cirripede cannot,
like a crab, crawl into some crevice and remain protected
till its shell becomes hardened; hence, probably, it is that<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" href="#Page_57"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span></a>
the shell is never<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[24]</span></a> wholly moulted. Even if the margins
of the opposed compartments and of the basis were to grow
rapidly, the shell would necessarily be much weakened on
the lines of suture, and unable to withstand the heavy
breakers, to which so many species of sessile Cirripedes are
exposed. On the other hand, although the margins are
thus compelled to grow slowly, they do not grow continuously,
as may be seen in the zones of increment on all
the valves, corresponding, I believe, with the periods of
exuviation of the membranes of the body. A layer of shell,
often very thin, seems to be generally deposited over the
whole internal surface of the several valves, at the same
time that the marginal zones are added; so that the only
essential difference in the growth of the external covering,
in Cirripedes as compared with ordinary Crustaceans, is that
the old shell is not cast off, but adheres to the outside of
the new shell, and that the margins are added to (in certain
definite directions) slowly yet not continuously, instead of
the whole being formed at a single period.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> In the genus <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, the whole of the external
membranes are moulted, excepting the surface of attachment; but then these
Cirripedes live in cavities which they form for themselves, and are thus protected.
In Lithotrya the membrane of the peduncle, with its little valves or
scales, is moulted, but here, again, this very part is protected by the tubular
cavity, which the animal forms and inhabits. Neither of these three genera
belong to the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, or sessile Cirripedes, which we are now more especially
describing.</p></div>

<p>If, now, a section of one of the shelly zones of growth be
carefully examined, it can in some cases be distinctly seen
to be formed of successive, excessively fine laminæ; but
the animalised tissue (which differs much in amount in
different Cirripedes) left after the shell has been dissolved
in acid, exhibits, in most cases, neither laminæ nor any other
structure whatever. The shell seems to be the actual pulpy
corium, or true skin, in a calcified condition, but generally
with its cellular structure modified and much reduced:
I have taken a bit of recently-formed shell of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>
and of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, with the corium still adherent to its under
surface, and after dissolution in acid, I could not distinguish
the part, which had just before existed as shell, from
the corium itself. In the case of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, immediately<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" href="#Page_58"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span></a>
prior to the period of moulting and growth, I found the
unaltered corium so charged, as to effervesce, with carbonate
of lime, either in a state of dissolution, or in granules
too minute to be visible under the highest powers.</p>

<p>The sutures between the several compartments and the
basis are covered by thin membrane, which is continually
splitting during the growth of the opposed edges of the
underlying shell; but previously to each splitting, a new
slip of membrane is, I believe, already formed under the old
one; so that the corium is not even momentarily exposed.
Owing to this manner of growth, the slips of membrane consist
of successive rims united together; in most cases, these
soon become abraded from the older parts of the shell, but are
sometimes preserved. The last-formed slip of membrane
over a suture is homologous with the opercular membrane;
and both are strictly analogous with the ring of
flexible membrane, forming the joint of the leg of a crab.
In the latter case, the flexible membrane and hardened
crust are both moulted together: in the opercular membrane,
there is a double line of splitting, one close round
the opercular valves, and the other at the basal edge of the
sheath, and the intermediate portion is moulted, but with a
zone of membrane left adherent to the non-moulted valves
and sheath: lastly, in the slips of membrane covering the
sutures, there is only a single line of splitting, and no portion,
I believe, is moulted; the rims of membrane on each
side remaining adherent on the compartments and basis,
until worn away.</p>

<p>The opercular membrane, when closely examined, exhibits
no structure, except that it can sometimes be plainly
seen to be composed of successive, numerous, excessively
thin laminæ. Occasionally, however, it presents the false
appearance of being permeated by parallel and anastomosing
vessels: this appearance is clue to one or more of the component
laminæ having been wrinkled before a succeeding
lamina was thrown down and attached to its under side.
If a small piece of an opercular valve of <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, with
the opercular membrane adhering to it, and with the
corium under both, be dissolved in acid, it may be clearly
made out that the corium under the valve has gone on<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" href="#Page_59"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span></a>
being converted into shell, whereas under the opercular
membrane it has been converted and condensed into fine
constituent laminæ of chitine. Inasmuch as the successive
layers of shell, during each period of growth, go on encroaching
on those of the membrane, the line of junction
between the shell and chitine becomes oblique or bevelled.
The membrane on this bevelled line of junction assumes a
slightly different aspect to what it has elsewhere; it becomes
yellowish or brown, thicker and very much tougher.
In many genera it is also furnished with a row of small
bristles. At the period of exuviation the opercular membrane
separates just outside this modified portion, leaving
the latter adherent, as a rim or slip, on the valves. If, however,
the opercular membrane be rudely torn off before its
proper period of exuviation, it carries with it the as yet continuous,
but already modified, slip. A slightly indented
line may sometimes be traced before the period of exuviation,
showing where the separation will take place: what
produces this line I know not. The coloured, thickened, and
modified slips of opercular membrane, which are thus retained
adhering to the valves, and which together form an investing
membrane, have been considered by most authors as the
epidermis; but they have no more right to be thus called
than has any other part of the opercular membrane. Exactly
similar slips of membrane are left investing the sheath. So,
again, the membrane which, when well preserved, invests
the walls of the shell, is made up, as already stated, of
successively adherent slips, which originally covered the
lines of suture.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[25]</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> In the case of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> there is a peculiarity, described in the last section
of this <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>, (under the head of Cementing Apparatus), namely, that the
two or three last-formed, exterior zones of the Basal membrane continue for a
period to increase in width; being, as I believe, dragged one from over the
other, with fresh laminæ of membrane continually thrown down. In this same
genus, and in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, the walls of the shell are invested by membrane, which is
doubled inwards under their basal edges; and as the latter grow, the investing
parietal membrane splits and separates from the basal membrane, and is pulled
outwards and downwards. This inflected, often broad border of membrane,
seems to me more strictly comparable with the opercular membrane, than with
those narrow, thickened rims of yellowish membrane which in other Cirripedes
cover the suture between the basal edges of the walls and the basis.</p></div>

<p>The little bristles above alluded to, which arise from the<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" href="#Page_60"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span></a>
slips of membrane left adherent on the opercular valves,
sheath, and walls, stand in rows; a row corresponding to each
period of exuviation of the opercular membrane. The bristles
are generally largest on the opercular valves and sheath;
in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>, they are from 1 to 2/1000ths of an inch
in length, but they are longer in some other species. I
may here mention, as showing the connexion of these
bristles with the opercular membrane, that similar bristles
occur in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>, scattered over the surface of that
membrane, and are necessarily moulted with it. In the
imbedded genera <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, none of these
bristles exist. When a portion of valve or shell, furnished
with bristles, is dissolved in acid, tough, sinuous,
and apparently hollow, threads are seen to run from
their bulb-like bases, into and up the corresponding layer,
which, before dissolution, existed as shell; and they
terminate internally in very fine points, which I believe
are united to the underlying corium. These threads, or
<i>tubuli</i>,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[26]</span></a> as I have called them in my volume on the Lepadidæ,
are, in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a>, about 1/5000ths of an inch in
diameter, but only half that size in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>. On
parts of the shell where there are no bristles, similar tubuli
penetrate the shelly layers, and come to the surface. The
tubuli running to the lowest and last-formed row of bristles,
just after a period of exuviation, are so delicate as hardly,
or not at all, to be distinguished; in the row above, they
are plain and longer, and for the next two or three upper
rows they are, in some cases, as in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a>,
longer and longer, having been added to during each successive
thickening of the valve. These tubuli consist of
chitine, and no doubt first existed as threads of corium;
they are so tough that they must serve to strengthen
the successive layers of shell, but I imagine their chief function
is to keep up the vitality of the newly-formed layers
of shell. May we not, also, venture to suppose that by their
means, some degree of sensibility is given to the bristles?<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" href="#Page_61"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span></a>
I need only further remark, that in some species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>
and of <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, the under side of the shell is penetrated
by irregular pores, large enough to be visible to the naked
eye, into which threads of corium penetrate; but these can
hardly be said to appertain to the microscopical structure;
and are more nearly related to those pores and furrows,
formed by the greater or less development of the longitudinal
septa, and in which the threads of corium deposit,
or rather become changed into, transverse septa, or solid
shelly matter, as previously described.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> I regret that I have used this term "tubuli"; for the threads thus designated,

shell from the leg of a crab, after having been placed in acid.</p></div>

<p>In the pupa, the thorax, as we shall hereafter more fully
see, is continuous with, and opens into the large anterior
end or front part of the head; but during the metamorphosis
(Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>), the thorax of the Cirripede becomes, owing
to the almost transverse position occupied by the young
animal within the pupa, to a great extent internally separated
from the anterior end,—which anterior end forms,
as we know, either the peduncle or the basis. Hence
it comes to pass that the body or Thorax (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>)
is lodged within a sack (<i>f</i>) within the shell. The chitine
membrane lining this sack is excessively thin and transparent,
but less so in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> and <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>; it is
obviously continuous with that investing the body of the
animal; it is also essentially continuous with the opercular
valves and membrane, and consequently with the whole shell.
It is periodically moulted. It is lined by corium, as is
likewise the surrounding shell; hence the corium is double
round the sack, as indeed might have been expected from
the shell and opercular valves (at least their upper parts)
being formed by the prolongation, as is obvious in the
pupa, of the posterior edges of the carapace. Between the
two folds of corium, which are united together by transverse
ligamentous fibres, branching out at both extremities,
like the roots and branches of a tree, we have the longitudinal
muscles, which go to the opercular valves; and likewise
a layer-like mass of branching ovarian tubes (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1, <i>g</i></a>):
the ovarian tubes, however, are often confined to the base<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" href="#Page_62"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span></a>
of the sack. In <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, the two folds of corium are
united by longitudinal membranous septa, making a series
of quite peculiar, square tubes.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned muscles are attached at their upper
ends to the opercular valves, and at their lower ends to the
basis. There are, in fact, three pairs, but the pair attached
to the basi-carinal angles of the two terga (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1, <i>i</i></a>),
are almost invariably confluent, forming one great bundle;
the second pair is attached to the lateral or basi-tergal
corners of the two scuta, and are hidden in the figure;
the third pair (<i>h</i>) is attached also to the scuta, to their
rostral angles. These muscles can only act as <span class="correction" title="In the original book: depressors">depressores</span>;
they are often extremely powerful; they belong to the voluntary
class, for they are transversely striped. By their action,
the opercular valves are capable of varied slight movements,
within the limit allowed by the width of the flexible opercular
membrane. By the action of the lateral scutal depressores,
the orifice leading into the sack is opened, the
movement being generally aided by the protrusion of
the cirri. By the sudden contraction of the rostral scutal
depressores, the blows which are sometimes given by the
beaked terga at the opposite end of the operculum, are
probably effected. By the contraction of all three pairs
of muscles, the opercular valves are held down with quite
surprising force. The valves can be raised only by the action
of the animal's body against the basis.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> these muscles are more spread out, and do
not extend down to the basis; their lower portions, as is
likewise the case in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, do not exhibit transverse
striæ, and hence tend to pass either into the involuntary
class, or into ligament. This condition of the muscles, in
the above two genera, accords with the little-developed state
of their opercular valves. In <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, there is no longer
any evidence of the muscles being collected into five or six
bundles, for they are thinly and almost uniformly spread
out, and show in no part transverse striæ. I may add that
in much elongated specimens of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, these
muscles become in their lower part ligamentous, and destitute
of striæ.</p>
</div>
<div class="no-section">

<h3 class="center"><a name="Branchiae" id="Branchiae" /><i>Branchiæ.</i></h3>

<p>In the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, a pair of Branchiæ is always present:
they lie on each side, in a somewhat curved position, in the
angle between the sides of the shell and the basis. In
Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, they are exactly covered, on the further side,
by the body of the animal. They are attached near each
other at the carinal end of the sack in a vertical line, and likewise
on each side in a transverse line, extending from close
beneath the spur of the tergum towards the point of attachment
of the body to the scutum. In <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, as in the figure
(Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f03">3</a>) of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, each branchia consists of
a medial fold of skin, a little curved conformably with the
sack, and slightly tapering towards its rostral and free extremity;
but this fold is almost hidden by the vertical sub-folds
or membranous ridges, themselves plicated and sub-plicated,
which project on both sides: these vertical folds
are free at their tips: at their lower attached ends, they
are thickest. On the side nearest the wall of the shell, the
whole branchia has a bilobed appearance, owing to a very
deep indentation caused by the projection of the scutal
lateral depressor muscle; the sub-folds on this side are also
more plicated. The branchia essentially is an inward
plicated fold of the membranes of the sack; for its outer, very
thin tunic is continuous with and moulted with that lining
the sack; and within it we have two layers of delicate, pulpy,
transparent corium, united together (as is best seen in
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>) by ligamentous fibres, branched at their two ends,
all exactly as in the corium surrounding the sack. There
are here no distinct vessels, any more than in other parts of
the body, but a fluid could easily circulate in the interspaces
of the corium. From the large size of this organ, and its
simplicity of internal structure, being adapted exclusively to
expose a great surface of skin to the water, I do not doubt
that it has been correctly considered as a respiratory organ.
By the voluntary movements of the opercular valves (<i>i. e.</i>
part of the carapace) the water is constantly being pumped
in and out of the sack; the movement, indeed, may be<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" href="#Page_64"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span></a>
almost compared to the heaving of a man's chest. Moreover,
the branchiæ on each side are attached so closely to
the spur of the tergum, that each time the latter is moved,
the whole branchia must, I think, be agitated, and the
folds opened, as by the action of a lever.</p>

<p>In our two commonest, tidal, sessile Cirripedes, viz.
<a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>, I have observed
that, when left uncovered by water, they kept the
orifice of their operculums a little open, with a bubble of air
within their sacks, so that the orifice was in fact closed by
a thin septum of water, with air beneath; when disturbed,
they closed their operculums with force, and expelled the
bubble of air with a clicking noise, which has been noticed by
Dr. Coldstream,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[27]</span></a> and has been thought to be made by the
movement of the operculum itself. <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>Bal. crenatus</i></a>, a deep-water
species, when out of water, keeps its operculum
closed.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>,
each branchia<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[28]</span></a> consists of two unequal folds, both plicated
on both sides: in the two latter genera, they extend
far down the deep and elongated sacks, and hence the
area of surface altogether gained is extremely great. In
most of the species of <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, the branchia consist of
a small fillet barely plicated: in the allied <a href="#Chamaesipho_columna"><i>Chamæsipho
columna</i></a>, they are rudimentary, forming a smooth little
pouch only 1/100th of an inch in length: in <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>Chthamalus
scabrosus</i></a> they are quite aborted, being perhaps represented
by a slight hairy ridge; but in <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>Chthamalus dentatus</i></a>, and
therefore within the limits of the same genus, the branchiæ
(and this seems to me a singular fact) are large, each being
composed of two plicated folds, as in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. Tapering filaments
situated near the bases of the cirri, such as those occurring
in several species of the Lepadidæ, are not found in any
sessile Cirripede; but I have observed nearly similar filaments,
projecting upwards and inwards at the base of the sack, in
several species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> and in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>; those which I<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" href="#Page_65"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span></a>
examined were simply occupied by delicate corium, and no
doubt must aid in exposing a greater surface of corium to
the circumambient water.</p>

<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, (but the two folds are shaded too unequally), in his 'Beiträge zur

<p>In my former volume on the Lepadidæ, I have described
the <i>ovigerous fræna</i> occurring on the two sides of the sack,
to which the <i>ovigerous lamellæ</i> are attached by a peculiar
glandular secretion: in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> there are no ovigerous
fræna, but the branchiæ just described are identical with
the fræna in essential structure and in position; differing
only in being placed a little nearer to the carinal end of the
sack, and in being generally (but not always) larger and
more plicated: seeing this, and that in <a href="#Alcippe_lampas"><i>Alcippe lampas</i></a>, and
in some species of Pollicipes,—the genus which comes
nearest to the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>,—the ovigerous fræna are large and
are destitute of glands, and have therefore lost their normal
function of supporting the ovigerous lamellæ, I can hardly
doubt that the <i>branchiæ</i> in the <span class="correction" title="In the original book, this word was italicized"><a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a></span> are the <i>ovigerous
fræna</i> of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book, this word was italicized">Lepadidæ</span> in a modified condition; a transformation

<p><span class="correction" title="In the original book this was the section title, but it has been demoted to a paragraph title to accomodate the TOC title."><i>Parts of the body included within the shell or carapace.</i></span>—These parts (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>) consist of the prominent
mouth, and of the thorax (<i>c′</i>), with its largely developed
portion, called the prosoma (<i>c</i>), and with its appendages.
The abdomen is quite rudimentary, being represented
merely by a small portion of membrane surrounding the
anus, and sometimes inserted like a wedge between the
inwardly inflected posterior thoracic segments; in only
two genera (<a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a> and <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>), its nature is
rendered somewhat plainer by supporting caudal appendages.
The probosciformed penis lies folded under the
thorax; and I believe (from what is seen in the anomalous
genus <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>), that it normally arises from the ventral<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" href="#Page_66"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span></a>
surface of the terminal point of the rudimentary abdomen.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[30]</span></a>
The thorax is laterally compressed, the ventral surface
being very narrow, with the bases of the cirri placed closely
together. It consists, in appearance, of two very different
portions; one a soft, more or less rounded bag, which I
have called the prosoma; and the other, which supports the
five posterior pairs of cirri, is narrower, invested with
stiffer membrane, and is more or less distinctly composed
of five segments. These segments (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f08">8</a>) on their
dorsal and dorso-lateral surfaces, are generally driven like
wedges one into the other, with their points directed anteriorly:
on the ventral surface the articulations are transverse.
The prolongation (<i>e</i>) of the thin membrane (<i>a</i>) surrounding
the anus (<i>b</i>), that is, the rudiment of the abdomen, which
sometimes carries caudal appendages, almost divides (in appearance,
whether really I know not) the hindermost thoracic
segment along the medio-dorsal line, into two parts. I
have given the above drawing of these segments, but with
the dorsal surface much flattened, in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a>;
in most species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, however, the wedges formed by
one segment being driven into another, are much sharper; on
the other hand, in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> they are nearly straight
and transverse. The three posterior segments are always
the most distinct; the two next segments are also distinct
laterally, but along the dorsal surface they become, excepting
in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> and some few other cases, completely
confluent. The greater distinctness of the posterior segments
is conformable to what takes place in the higher Crustacea.
The articulations between the segments are folded inwards,
and are formed of thin membrane, which in some
cases, as in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a>, forms a marked contrast
with the much thicker, stiffer, and yellowish membrane of
the segments themselves; in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>, how<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" href="#Page_67"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span></a>ever,
the whole membrane of the five thoracic segments is
very thin, excepting small wedge-shaped portions along the
medio-dorsal line. The infolded articulations between the
segments supporting the three anterior pairs of cirri (at
least in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>), are much wider than those between
the three posterior segments; the former segments, with their
cirri, being consequently capable of being moved further apart
from each other. Could there have been any doubt as to
the distinctness and reality of the five thoracic segments, it
would have been set aside by the arrangement of the
muscles attached to them, as will presently be described.
I need only add, that in many genera there are shield-like
swellings at the exterior bases of the pedicels of the posterior
cirri, which I for some time thought were the epimeral elements
of the thoracic segments; but I now believe them to be
parts of the pedicels of the cirri. The basi-exterior margin,
moreover, of the pedicel of the third pair of cirri, in many
species of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>), is produced as a plate,
thickly fringed with fine hairs, half across the dorsal surface
of the thorax; serving, apparently, as a brush to clean the
sack, or to prevent the ingress of any intruding substance.</p>

elongated abdomen; a view which, at the commencement of my examination, I
was tempted to admit; but the position of the caudal appendages on the dorsal
basis of the penis, suffice, I think, to show that this view is not correct; for
these caudal appendages evidently correspond with those borne on the very
extremity of the abdomen in the pupa. Nor, indeed, does the position of the
anus accord well with such a view.</p></div>

<p>The soft, rounded, bag-like portion of the body, which I
have called the prosoma, is usually separated by a notch
from the five posterior thoracic segments; at its upper end
it may be said to carry the mouth and first pair of cirri.
The prosoma includes the main part of the stomach and the
broad ends of the vesiculæ seminales. It is always clothed
by very thin membrane, which in <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>Chthamalus dentatus</i></a>, is
hairy. In <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, the prosoma is
much elongated, being produced far down the deep sack.
That the prosoma is mainly formed by a great development
of that segment (homologically the second thoracic segment)
which carries the first pair of cirri, is certain, and I should
not have hesitated to have said that it was exclusively so
formed, had not the first thoracic segment in the anomalous
genus <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> been developed as a distinct and
free segment, not attached to the carapace; showing that
possibly in other Cirripedes, the dorsal half of this first thoracic
segment may be concerned in the formation of the free
prosoma.</p>

<p><span class="correction" title="In the original book, this paragraph title was part of the section title."><i>Attachment of the Body to the Shell.</i></span>—The prosoma which carries the posterior thoracic segments,
and in appearance the mouth, is the only part of the body
which is attached to the general covering (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>),
namely, to the opercular valves. Except through the continuity
of the lining membranes of the sack, the body lies free
within the walls of the shell. The area of attachment (shown
by a sinuous broken line round <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>) extends from about
the middle of the two scuta down to their basal margins. As
these valves lie obliquely across the orifice of the shell, the
animal's body comes to be suspended almost in the middle
of the sack. The two scuta, as we have seen, have the
power of opening and shutting a little; and are brought
together by the adductor scutorum muscle (<i>a</i>), which is
generally very powerful. The body is attached to these
valves, round and beneath the adductor, so as to hide it
until one of the valves be removed. The attachment is
chiefly effected by three pairs of widely expanded, superficial
muscles, two pairs of which are spread over the
flanks of the prosoma, and the third pair over its rounded
(properly dorsal) surface, which lies close to the rostral
compartment (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>) of the shell. I should have stated,
that my chief examination of the attachment of the body
to the scutal valves, has been made on <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>Coronula balænaris</i></a>,
and less closely on <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>. Within these
three pairs of superficial muscles, there are (besides the
adductor) no less than five other pairs; of these one
long pair is attached at one end to the basal margin of
the labrum (<i>e</i>), and at the other end, to the under side,
near to the basal margin of the scuta: two other, shorter,
parallel pairs of muscles are attached at one end to the
interspace of membrane between the basal edge of the
labrum and the adductor scutorum muscle, and at the other
end, to the under side of the scuta, above the attachment of
the first pair: the fourth and shortest pair curls close under
the adductor, and is there attached at both ends beneath it.
The action of these four pairs of muscles must be to draw
back, from the orifice of the shell, the mouth, and that inter<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" href="#Page_69"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span></a>space
of body between the basal margin of the labrum and
the adductor muscle. This movement I saw in living specimens.
The last and fifth pair of muscles is small, but of
considerable length; it is a diverging pair, attached at the
converging end, above and exteriorly to the adductor muscle;
and at the diverging end, low down on the under side of
the scuta; I am very doubtful regarding the function of
this pair. Altogether we have seen that round and within
the fleshy pedicel, by which the body is attached to the
scuta, there are no less than eight pairs of muscles. The
central space between these muscles is hollow, and here
many lacunal channels seem to converge. These muscles
receive nerves from the supra-œsophageal ganglions. The
interspace above alluded to, between the basal edge of
the labrum and the adductor scutorum muscle, occupies a
very different position according as the animal's body is
protruded as far as it can be, or is retracted. It is homologically
part of the third cephalic segment; and consequently
the mouth ought to have stood posteriorly (<i>i. e.</i>
above, in the position figured in Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>) to this interspace;
yet, in fact, when the animal is retracted within
its shell, the mouth usually lies almost directly beneath this
interspace and the adductor scutorum muscle.</p>

<p>Besides these muscles of attachment, the prosoma is furnished
with several other muscles. There are superficial
muscles running up towards the basal margin of the sides
of the mouth; and other deeper muscles, to which, I presume,
the movements of the mouth, as a whole, are due.
The muscles moving the gnathites do not, as far as I could
make out, extend beneath the basal edge of the mouth.
There are, also, powerful muscles giving movement to the
basal segments of the pedicel of the first pair of cirri.
Again, there are superficial muscles running to the next
succeeding thoracic segment; the anterior ends of which
are separated by a clear interspace from the lower ends of the
above-described superficial muscles, by which the prosoma
is attached to the scuta. On each flank, moreover, but more
deeply imbedded, are the long flexor and extensor muscles,
presently to be described, running to the five posterior
thoracic segments. The last muscle which I need here<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" href="#Page_70"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span></a>
mention, is a deep-seated diverging pair, attached near the
upper end of the stomach, on its ventral surface, and diverging
from this point to the sides of the prosoma high up
beneath the mouth. The probable action of this pair, as
well as of the three superficial pairs of muscles by which
the body is attached to the scuta, is to draw up the whole
prosoma towards or from the orifice; and likewise to contract
it firmly, so as to serve as a fulcrum for the movements
of the five posterior thoracic segments, together with the
cirri, which they carry.</p>

<p>The muscles of these five thoracic segments are numerous
and powerful; they are also complicated, chiefly owing
to the segments on their dorsal and dorso-lateral surfaces
being driven, like wedges, one into the other. As far as I
could make out, there are on each side three, superficial,
dorso-lateral and lateral muscles (generally, if not always,
destitute of striæ), which do not cross the articulations, but
extend merely from articulation to articulation; and of which
the function can be only to contract each separate segment,
and consequently to open out the intermediate infolded articulations;
the effect of this would be to separate slightly the
cirri from each other,—more especially those borne on the
two or three anterior segments, between which the infolded
articulations are deeper or broader. There are other more
deeply imbedded, powerful, long, dorso-lateral extensor,
and ventri-lateral flexor muscles, attached at one end
within the flanks of the prosoma, and at the other end to
the successive segments of the thorax. The action of the
former is to straighten and stretch out the thorax; of the
latter, or ventri-lateral muscles, to retract it. In tracing
these muscles, a fascia could be seen to become attached to
a segment, and then this same fascia would run on to the
next succeeding segment: the effect of this must be, that
each segment can be retracted and protracted either from
the prosoma as a fulcrum, or from the antecedent segment
as a fulcrum: we have, also, seen that each segment can,
by the agency of the superficial, non-striated muscles,
contract itself. Hence these thoracic segments are capable
of diverse movements, as was very evident when the shell
of a living specimen was opened. By one movement in<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" href="#Page_71"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span></a>
common, the whole five posterior segments could be drawn
back, so as to become even partly imbedded in the prosoma:
lateral, twisting or wriggling movements were also quite distinct:
the three posterior segments seemed to be capable of
less independent movements than the anterior segments; and
I observed that the more powerful flexor and extensor muscles
did not run into these three posterior segments. The
cirri, of course, partake of the movements of the thorax;
and in watching, in an uninjured specimen, the alternate,
protruding, gracefully sweeping and retracting movements
of the posterior pairs of cirri, it was evident that the thorax
was the chief agent in their movement. Besides the muscles
now mentioned, there are some immediately to be
noticed, which extend from within the thoracic segments to
within the pedicels of the cirri.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Movements_and_Muscles_of_the_Cirri" id="Movements_and_Muscles_of_the_Cirri" /><i>Movements and Muscles of the Cirri.</i></h3>

<p>Although the
cirri have not been described, it will be most convenient
here to treat shortly of their muscles. Each cirrus consists
of a pedicel, having a long basal and a short upper segment,
supporting two multiarticulate rami. The lower
segment of the pedicel can be drawn forward by an adductor
muscle, attached low down within this segment, and
crossing at right angles (at least in the case of the
anterior cirri) the corresponding muscle of the opposed
cirrus, on the central, ventral surface of the thorax. This
segment can also be drawn back by a muscle springing
from the dorso-lateral surface of the thorax, and running
only a little way within the segment: I am far from sure
that the lower segment does not possess other muscles.
The short upper segment of the pedicel can be moved backwards
and forwards, as I saw in living specimens, independently
of the lower segment; this movement being best
seen in the anterior cirri, which are much more often moved
independently of each other than are the posterior cirri.
The rami are capable, I believe, of being moved backwards
and forwards <em>as a whole</em>, by the movement of the few lower
segments, which are generally more or less confluent.
They can, also, be curled up and uncurled by the combined
movement of each separate segment. The uncurling seems
to separate the two rami a little laterally. Each ramus, at<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" href="#Page_72"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span></a>
least in the two or three anterior pairs, can be moved to a
certain extent, independently of the other ramus of the
same cirrus; and the few terminal segments, either of both
rami or of one ramus, are often a little moved and curled
(and this is especially the case with the long anterior ramus
of the first pair), without the lower segments or the pedicel
being moved.</p>

<p>The flexor and extensor muscles, which, as I believe,
move the upper segment of the pedicel (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>,
fig. <a href="#p29f01">1</a>), are attached at their upper ends to its basal margin,
and are thus enabled to draw it a little way down within
the lower segment, and so move it. The short flexor muscle
(<i>c</i>), which is attached at its lower end within the upper
segment of the pedicel, and the longer extensor (<i>d</i>), also,
attached within this same lower segment, serve, I believe,
to move the lower, partially confluent segments of each
ramus as a whole. In the case of these muscles, and of
those last mentioned, I am surprised that the extensors (<i>b</i>)
and (<i>d</i>) are not attached nearer to the exterior and dorsal
surface. Other muscles (<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>) attached at their lower ends
within the upper segment of the pedicel, run up each of
the two rami to their tips, with some of the fasciæ terminating
within each segment: of these muscles, the outer
one (<i>f</i>, <i>f</i>) appears to be the extensor, and the inner one
(<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>) the flexor. But besides these, there are other short
flexor muscles (<i>g</i>, <i>g</i>) which run on the anterior face,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[31]</span></a> from
segment to segment, serving to pull the front edge of one
segment within the edge of the next lower segment. These
muscles differ much in plainness in the several genera: they
are very distinct in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. In some specimens of this
genus, a few of the articulations between the basal segments
of the rami having been obliterated, the short muscles (<i>g</i>, <i>g</i>)
running from articulation to articulation were absent, and
their presence and nature in the upper segments thus rendered
the plainer. The muscular system in the several
pairs of cirri seems to be the same, with the exception of<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" href="#Page_73"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span></a>
the first pair, in which the muscle answering, as I suppose,
to (<i>a</i>), namely, the flexor of the upper segment of the
pedicel, is much spread out at its lower end, and is there
attached to the exterior surface of the lower segment.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> For a considerable time I thought that there were muscles going to the
spines, especially to those which arise from the upper dorsal edge of each
segment; but I have since ascertained that these are the cases within which
new spines, with their lower ends doubled like the fingers of a glove hastily
pulled off, are in process of formation.</p></div>

<p>The backward and forward movements of the segments,
both in the rami and in the pedicels of the cirri, are apparently
effected, as already noticed, by the outer or inner (as
the movement may be) basal edge of one segment being
drawn a little way down within the next succeeding lower
segment. If, at the same time, both the inner and outer
margins of all the segments were drawn one within the
other, the whole limb would necessarily be shortened; and
I distinctly saw a shortening action, with very slight movement
in any other direction, in the first and second pairs
of cirri; and I think it almost certain that this movement
might be performed by the other cirri. If I correctly understand
a statement of Milne Edwards,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[32]</span></a> this is an important
fact, as he asserts that only the higher Crustaceans possess
the power of shortening their limbs.</p>

<p>When a Cirripede is alive, the action of the cirri is really
beautiful: from the position of the thoracic segments, the
posterior cirri (three pairs in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> and four pairs in
the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>) form a sort of semicircle facing the mouth:
the anterior cirri stand further apart, and are opposed in
pairs to each other, with the first pair pointing beyond the
mouth. Together the cirri form a hollow cone, not circular
but elongated, with the mouth situated at the lower anterior
end. The posterior cirri are protruded, by the movement
of the whole thorax, curled up, close along the carinal end
of the orifice; as they are protruded, they diverge, both by
the movement of their pedicels, and, as I believe, by the
separation of the thoracic segments. As the two rami of each
separate cirrus are uncurled, they also diverge a little; as
do the double rows of spines on the segments in each
ramus, by their elasticity. By the movement of the thorax,
the cirri are then swept towards the rostrum; and, lastly, they
are brought perpendicularly down towards the mouth with
a rapid movement, which would be beautifully adapted to
catch any object floating or swimming in the water; hence<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" href="#Page_74"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span></a>
I have called the action of the cirri, captorial. When the
shell of a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> is broken open, the second and third
pairs of cirri are repeatedly clasped over the mouth with a
convulsive movement, in a manner indicating, I think, that
their chief function is to seize and carry to the mouth any
object entangled by the sweeping movement of the three
posterior pairs. The first pair is also well adapted to aid
in this seizing action; but I suspect that the long anterior
ramus likewise acts as an organ of touch, warning the
animal of danger. The mouth being itself moveable as a
whole,—the outer maxillæ being capable of a backward
and forward sweeping action, and being furnished with
orifices apparently olfactory,—the inner maxillæ having
more diversified movements,—the toothed mandibles overhanging
the œsophagus,—and the œsophagus itself possessing
a powerful swallowing movement, are all admirably
adapted to secure any prey, when once entangled by the
cirri.</p>
</div>
<div class="no-section">

<h3 class="center"><a name="Mouth" id="Mouth" /><i>Mouth.</i></h3>

<p>The mouth, in the sub-family <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, cannot be
distinguished from that of the Lepadidæ, which has been
pretty fully described in my former volume. In the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, however, the labrum differs considerably in not
being swollen; that is, in its outer and inner fold of membrane
being close together, and in having a central notch:
the palpi are also larger, and the lower teeth on the mandibles,
are laterally (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f05">5</a>) double, as will be more
particularly stated under these two sub-families. I have
given a drawing (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f01">1</a>) of the mouth, seen from
above, of <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Balanus perforatus</i></a>, with the right-hand palpus (<i>d′</i>)
and outer maxilla (<i>a′</i>) cut off, in order that the labrum (<i>e</i>),
mandibles (<i>c</i>), and inner maxilla (<i>b</i>) might be better
shown; the cut-off bases (<i>x</i>, <i>x</i>) of the first cirrus on each
side are also shown. In fig. <a href="#p26f02">2</a> we have the deep supra-œsophageal
cavity in <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>Bal. improvisus</i></a> torn open and laid
flat, with the inner surfaces of the labrum (<i>c</i>) and outer
maxillæ (<i>a</i>) exhibited, the palpi, mandibles, and inner
maxillæ having been removed. Figs. <a href="#p26f03">3</a> and <a href="#p26f04">4</a> will presently
be referred to; they are parts of the mouth, with the muscles,<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" href="#Page_75"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span></a>
&amp;c. removed, of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. The mouth differs extremely
little in the different genera and species of the
<a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, much less than amongst the Lepadidæ. In the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, the crest of the labrum is sometimes hairy, instead
of having, as is usual, from two to six teeth on each
side of the central notch: in <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>Balanus improvisus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>,
fig. <a href="#p26f02">2</a>) and <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>eburneus</i></a>, and in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia"><i>Chelonobia</i></a>, the crest on each
side of the central notch (<i>e′</i>) is furnished with a row of finely
graduated teeth. A sub-triangular portion of the inner
fold of membrane of the labrum, which overhangs the
œsophagus, is always thickened and yellowish; it is also
often punctured in patterns (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f02">2</a>, <i>f</i>), which, I
believe, give attachment to little muscles that serve to open
the upper end of the œsophagus. Opposite to this thickened,
sub-triangular portion of membrane, the thin membrane
forming the supra-œsophageal cavity (or the cavity surrounded
by the gnathites) is strengthened by a pair of
curved ribs (<i>h</i>, fig. <a href="#p26f02">2</a>) of thickened yellowish membrane,
running down from the inner bases (<i>a′′</i>) of the bilobed
outer maxillæ to the opening of the œsophagus (<i>g</i>): a
broad branch from each of these ribs supports the sides of
the orifice of the œsophagus; and this branch almost joins
on to a slightly thickened rim or bar (<i>f′</i>), which branches
off from the upper part of the sub-triangular (<i>f</i>) inner fold
of the labrum. This structure, in <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>Bal. improvisus</i></a>, is represented
in Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f02">2</a>, as well as it could be, considering
that the deep supra-œsophageal cavity has to be torn open;
and then laid flat.</p>

<p>The <i>Palpi</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f06">6</a>) differ little, except in size, in
the different genera, being squarish, more or less elongated,
or even approaching to club-shaped: in most of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>
they are larger even than the mandibles, of which
they normally form a part. Their upper margins, especially
towards their free extremities, are always thickly clothed with
spines; and there is generally a single row, either short (<i>r</i>)
or long, of spines of greater length, which arise from a little
above, and stand almost in a parallel line to, the basal
margin. On the internal surface, there is sometimes a
row (<i>t</i>) of very short little spines, which overhang the crest
of the labrum. The <i>Mandibles</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f05">5</a>) have from<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" href="#Page_76"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span></a>
three to five teeth; the lower point or angle is generally
pectinated. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and its close allies, there are some
small teeth intermediate between the four or five main
teeth; and in these genera, though members of the sub-family
<a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, the lower teeth exhibit only rudiments of
being laterally double.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[33]</span></a> The <i>Maxillæ</i> sometimes have a
notch under the upper large pair of spines, and in <a href="#Octomeris_brunnea"><i>Octomeris
brunnea</i></a> there is a double notch: in many species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>,
the inferior corner stands up like a step (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>,
fig. <a href="#p26f07">7</a>, <i>a</i>): in many other genera and species, the whole edge
is straight. In all, or almost all cases, the row of spines on
the middle portion is double. The <i>Outer Maxillæ</i> are always
bilobed on their inner faces, and are clothed with bristles.
On all the gnathites, the bristles are often doubly serrated.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> M. Martin St. Ange describes, in his 'Mémoire sur l'Organisation des
Cirripèdes,' pp. 15 and 32, "<i>une petite langue</i>" in the mouth of Lepas; but I
may venture to assert that such does not exist; it is merely the point of union
between the outer maxillæ. M. St. Ange, in his comparison of the mouth of
Lepas with that of Phyllosoma, compares the mandible of the latter with the
palpus of Lepas; the first maxilla of Phyllosoma with the mandible of Lepas;
and so on with the other gnathites.</p></div>

<p><i>Muscles and functions of the Gnathites, and their confluence.</i>—The
outer maxillæ appear at first like a deeply-lobed
lower lip, for they reach over almost to the labrum
(Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f01">1</a>), and thus partially cover the other organs;
they are separately capable of a strong and rapid, to and fro
movement, by which no doubt they sweep any prey, entangled
by the cirri, towards the other gnathites. Each
outer maxilla is furnished with a pair of muscles, apparently
a flexor and extensor; there is also a little muscle between
the two maxillæ, I presume for the purpose of bringing
them together. The outer and inner maxillæ generally
stand close together, and in several genera a little way
apart, from the mandibles; but there is no trace of any
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: labium">labrum</span> or true lower lip, bounding the mandibles and
orifice of the œsophagus. The outer and inner maxillæ and
mandibles are not opposed in pairs to each other, but
against the thickened inner fold of the labrum; almost in
the same manner as the posterior pairs of cirri are not
opposed one to the other, but to the mouth.</p>

<p>I have described pretty accurately the muscles of the<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" href="#Page_77"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span></a>
mandibles in my former volume, and there given a drawing
(Pl. 10, fig. 1) of them. There are four muscles: first, the
depressor muscle, which is the largest, and is attached, at its
upper end, to ligamentous apodemes under the free toothed
portion of the jaw; and at its lower end, spreading considerably
out, is attached to a concavity close above the basal margin
of the labrum; to understand the action of these muscles, it
should be borne in mind that the mandible almost faces
the labrum. In some genera, as in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[34]</span></a> the swelling
near the basal margin of the labrum (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f03">3</a>, <i>k</i>), caused
by the internal concavity for the above muscle, is conspicuous.
The depressor muscle is opposed by a small elevator,
attached to the mandible close by the depressor; thence
it runs upwards, and is united at its upper end to the base
of the palpus, at the point where the latter adheres to the
labrum: I have ventured to call this muscle the elevator,
from being apparently so well fitted for this purpose; but
I feel some little doubt, from having observed an apparent
slight movement in the palpi of living Balani; and this is
the only muscle entering those organs. The free part of
the mandible is articulated on a square, thickened piece of
membrane, forming part of the side of the mouth (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>,
figs. <a href="#p26f03">3</a>, <a href="#p26f04">4</a>, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: c 1"><i>c<sup>1</sup></i></span>; and Pl. 10, fig. 1, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, in my volume on the
Lepadidæ); to this square piece of membrane, two short
muscles are attached, one above the other, and which ought,
in the Plate in my former volume, to have been represented
crossing the depressor muscle at nearly right angles; at
their further ends they are attached to about the middle of
the labrum, where, at least in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f03">3</a>, <i>i</i>), a
slight concavity can be detected. The action of these two
muscles must be to draw the whole mandible against the
labrum; and the depressor muscle might, at the same time,
draw the toothed edge downwards, and thus force any prey
into the œsophagus.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> This is figured by Burmeister in his 'Beiträge zur Naturgeschichte der
Rankenfüsser,' Tab. 2, fig. 6.</p></div>

<p>The inner maxillæ are likewise furnished with four muscles,
very nearly as figured in my former volume (Pl. 10, fig. 10);
namely, two muscles, one inside and the other outside the
curious apodeme, which in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f07">7</a>, <i>b′</i>) is<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" href="#Page_78"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span></a>
as invariably present as in the Lepadidæ: these two
muscles are attached at their lower ends to the outer membrane
of the mouth, close to its basal articulation: the
outer one of these two muscles would, I presume, act as
an elevator, and the inner one as a depressor; the free
part of the organ working on the top of the apodeme, like
an axe, on a hinge, on the top of a pole. But there is also
a larger depressor muscle, in an analogous position with
that (<i>i. e.</i> the first-mentioned muscle) of the mandibles; and
a fourth muscle, crossing the latter depressor at nearly
right angles, and attached (as far as I could make out) on
the side of the orifice of the œsophagus, close under the
mandibles: the action of this latter muscle would be to
draw the whole organ towards the labrum.</p>

<p>I must not conclude my description of the mouth,
without drawing particular attention to its peculiar compounded
nature. It is prominent, and is capable, as a
whole, of movement; it is separated from the body by a
fold or articulation, which can be traced all round. It is,
as we have seen, composed of a broad labrum and three
pairs of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: gnathites;">gnathites,</span> which latter have only their terminal
segments free; and these surround a conical hollow, at the
bottom of which lies the opening of the œsophagus. The
prominence of the whole mouth appears to result from the
lateral fusion of the two basal segments of the three pairs
of gnathites. I have examined the mouth of ordinary
Crustaceans, and can see no trace of a structure like this.
That there has been some union of the parts is indisputable;
for the palpi, which in ordinary Crustaceans are quite
free, are here firmly united to the upper and outer corners
of the labrum; and indeed, at first appear to be more intimately
connected with the labrum than with the mandibles.
The palpus on its upper and exterior surface, is in direct continuity
with the square thickened piece of membrane, on
which the mandible is articulated, and likewise with that
side of the upper or free portion of the mandible which
faces the labrum. This face of the mandible, beneath the
toothed edge, is hollowed out or arched (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f05">5</a>, <i>p</i>),
owing to the above-mentioned continuity of its membrane
with that of the palpus. On the lower surface, the palpus is<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" href="#Page_79"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span></a>
firmly united to the lateral corners of the labrum; or indeed
the corners of the labrum may be almost said to be formed
by the soft, swollen bases of the palpi: the point of union,
when viewed from the outside, is seen to form a knob on
the shoulder of the labrum, beneath the level of its crest,
and at this knob (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f03">3</a>, close to <i>d′</i>) several thickened
bands in the surrounding membrane unite. The free
portion of the palpus stands out transversely behind (<i>i. e.</i>
anteriorly to, in a homological sense) the labrum. I suspect
that the palpus possibly may consist of two segments, of
which the terminal one is free, and the lower one confluent
with the labrum.</p>

<p>Before proceeding any further, I should observe that figs.
<a href="#p26f03">3</a> and <a href="#p26f04">4</a>, in Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, represent the membranes of the mouth of
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a>, perfectly cleaned. In fig. <a href="#p26f03">3</a>, all the front
part of the mouth has been removed, the mandible on one
side, the labrum with the two palpi, and the œsophagus being
alone left, and these are viewed from the inner side; the front
part, however, of the supra-œsophageal cavity has been cut
away. In fig. <a href="#p26f04">4</a>, the labrum, with the œsophagus, has been
removed, whilst the two outer maxillæ, the right-hand inner
maxilla and mandible (with the exterior and basal portions,
<i>d</i>, <i>d′′</i>, of one palpus) are seen from the outside; but in order
that these parts should all be shown, the whole of the
right-hand side of the mouth has been spread out, for the
teeth of the mandible should have stood in a vertical line
between the two outer maxillæ. In the mandibles, the free
upper part is separated, by a distinct articulation, from the
square piece of thickened membrane (fig. <a href="#p26f03">3</a>, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: c 1"><i>c<sup>1</sup></i></span>) on which it
is supported; and this latter is separated by a second articulation
from a portion of thickened membrane (<span class="correction" title="In the original book: c 2"><i>c<sup>2</sup></i></span>), the basal
edge of which forms the third and lowest articulation, separating
the mouth from the body. This basal, thickened
portion of membrane curls round and inwards, towards the
outer maxillæ or front of the mouth, and its terminal points
sometimes even penetrate a little way within the muscles,
like apodemes: it is not distinctly separated by any line or
suture from the membrane, which forms the whole broad
labrum; so that I at first concluded that the labrum dipped
under the mandibles, and thus afforded a support on which
they were articulated; but this appears so opposed to all<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" href="#Page_80"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span></a>
analogy, that it is more probable that the above basal
thickened portion of membrane is truly the basal segment
of the mandibles, completely confluent with the labrum; and
it is, I think, not very improbable that even a large portion
of what in appearance belongs to the labrum, namely, those
concavities to which the muscles of the mandibles are
attached, may, also, be part of the basal segment of the
mandibles. Whether or no there really are two segments
beneath the upper free portion of the mandibles, which have
become laterally confluent with other parts, I must think
that the square thickened piece of membrane (<span class="correction" title="In the original book: c 1"><i>c<sup>1</sup></i></span>) represents
at least one segment. I may here observe, that
Prof. Milne Edwards seems to consider the mandible of the
higher Crustaceans as answering homologically to the haunch
of the leg; but, according to M. Brullé,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[35]</span></a> there ought to be
two basal segments (sous-maxillaire and maxillaire) bearing
the proper mandible, and giving rise, on the outer side, to
the palpus,—a structure which perfectly corresponds with
my view of the mandible and palpus in Cirripedes.</p>

<p><i>Maxillæ</i>: the point whence the long apodeme (<i>b′</i>, Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>,
fig. <a href="#p26f04">4</a> and fig. <a href="#p26f07">7</a>) arises, according to Audouin's views, must
mark an articulation, and this would separate the upper
free segment from the lower segments, which I believe to
be laterally confluent with the organs on each side. The
thickened membrane, of which the upper free part is formed,
extends a little distance beyond the insertion of the apodeme;
and this small portion beneath the point of insertion
may possibly answer to the square, thickened piece of
membrane, or second segment, supporting the mandibles.
Beneath it, a rather wide expanse of thin, flexible membrane
reaches down to the basal fold surrounding the mouth, and
may thus form the third segment.</p>

<p><i>Outer Maxillæ</i>: the upper free segment has a spinose
lobe (<i>a′′</i>, Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, figs. <a href="#p26f02">2</a> and <a href="#p26f04">4</a>), on its inner face, which
may indicate a lower and second, almost free segment.
Passing over this, we have, on the outside of the mouth,
beneath the free, upper segments, an expanse of membrane,
which, on the side, close to the inner maxillæ, is perforated
(Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f04">4</a>, <i>n</i>) by orifices which I believe are olfactory.
In some species, as in <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>Bal. eburneus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a>, there<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" href="#Page_81"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span></a>
is a longitudinal medial suture in this expanse of membrane,
which I suppose indicates the lateral confluence of
the middle segments of the two outer maxillæ. A short,
transverse articulation or fold separates this middle segment
(fig. <a href="#p26f04">4</a>, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: a 1"><i>a<sup>1</sup></i></span>) of each maxilla from the third or basal
segment; and this latter (<span class="correction" title="In the original book: a 2"><i>a<sup>2</sup></i></span>) is separated from the
body by a very distinct fold, which (at least amongst
the Lepadidæ) sends inwards a short, medial, tongue-formed
apodeme. Here, then, we apparently have, as in
the mandibles, two segments under the upper free segment
of each outer maxilla, laterally confluent with the adjoining
organs. But I must state that, in old specimens, and only
in old specimens of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a>, I have found under
the outer maxilla an additional transverse ridge and fold,
which plainly shows how easily a mere thickening of the
membrane might be mistaken for an articulation. I can,
however, hardly persuade myself that the articulated membrane,
under the free part of the mandibles, which has now
been figured and described, has no homological signification;
and the fusion of the palpus and labrum seems
too plain to be mistaken. Hence I must conclude that the
mouth, in the Cirripedia, does truly exhibit a compounded
structure of a very peculiar nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="no-section">

<h3 class="center"><a name="Cirri" id="Cirri" /><i>Cirri.</i></h3>

<p>There are always six <span class="correction" title="In the original book: pair;">pairs;</span> each biramous and multiarticulated,
supported on a pedicel formed of two segments.
A shield-like swelling at the exterior bases of these pedicels
often appears like another segment; but such, I believe, is
not its nature. The five posterior pairs answer to the five
pairs of ambulatory legs in the higher Crustaceans; and
as in the case of the latter, the three, or the four hindermost
pairs almost invariably resemble each other. The
first pair, which is homologous with the outer maxillipeds
of ordinary Crustaceans, is separated by an interval from the
second pair;—though this is not the case with the legs of the
pupa, from which the cirri are metamorphosed. These anterior
cirri are attached to the lateral edges of the mouth, namely to
the thickened rim of membrane, forming the supposed basal<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" href="#Page_82"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span></a>
segment of the mandibles. They are capable of more
diversified movements than the other cirri: the anterior
ramus is always elongated, with the terminal segments more
or less tapering, and is directed beyond (or anteriorly to)
the mouth: the shorter ramus closely resembles in structure
the rami of the second pair. In the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a> the
second pair, and in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> the second and third
pairs (as will be more particularly described under these
sub-families) differ in structure from the posterior pairs,
from which they are separated by a slight interval. The
number of segments on the posterior cirri is often great,
amounting in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a> even to fifty. Each segment
normally is furnished on its inner face, which is usually
somewhat protuberant, with from two to rarely eight or ten
pairs of long spines or bristles, placed in a double row;
the two spines in the lower pairs stand nearer to each
other, and are shorter than the spines in the upper pairs.
Between each pair of spines there is either a single, very
thin bristle, or often a tuft of such. The pairs are directed
somewhat upwards, and they diverge when the cirri are uncurled;
their function is obviously to entangle the prey.
On the dorsal or exterior surface of each segment, close to
its upper margin, there is a tuft of spines, often composed
of thicker and thinner spines; these, I believe, serve to prevent
any creature intruding within the sack. On both sides
of the upper margin of each segment, there is generally a
row of short, blunt, excessively minute spines, which only
deserve notice, inasmuch as it is by their increase in number
and size, and by the spreading out of the dorsal tufts, and,
lastly, by the increase of the little tuft intermediate between
the pairs of spines situated in front, that the segments
on the two or three anterior pairs of cirri become
covered, like brushes, with bristles. The bristles or spines on
the second and third cirri are often, especially in <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>,
doubly and coarsely pectinated. The bristles on the pedicels
follow the same arrangement as on the rami; namely,
being in regular pairs on the posterior cirri, and crowded
thickly, like a brush, on the anterior cirri. The segments
in the shorter ramus of the first cirrus, and in both rami of
the second, and often of the third cirrus, are broader than<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" href="#Page_83"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span></a>
the segments of the posterior cirri; they are, also, especially
in the genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, frequently produced in their
upper, ante-lateral corners, into remarkable prolongations
(see Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f04">4</a>, of the third cirrus of <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Bal. perforatus</i></a>),
clothed on their inner surfaces, and at their extremities, by
numerous bristles. The number of the segments in each
cirrus is in some degree variable, and increases with age;
this is likewise the case, to a certain extent, with the
number of the spines borne on each segment.</p>

<p>As compared with ordinary Crustaceans, I presume the
two rami answer to the "<i>tige</i>" and "<i>palpe</i>" of Milne
Edwards; and the pedicel (as I have called it) to the two
basal segments of the leg.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[36]</span></a> The "<i>fouet</i>" or flabellum
does not appear to be developed in any Cirripede; for
though the filamentary appendages in certain genera of
Lepadidæ, might at first be thought to be of this nature,
yet their usual position <i>beneath</i> the basal articulation of the
first pair of cirri, and the occasional presence of more than
one, proves, I think, that such is not the case.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> According to this author's new nomenclature, the pedicel would consist of
the coxopodite and basipodite; the tige would be the ischiopodite and following
segments; and the palpe would be the exopodite; the epipodite or flabellum
being absent. ('Annales des Sciences Naturelles,' tom. xviii, 1852.)</p></div>

<p>Though the structure of the cirri is very uniform, yet we
meet with some peculiarities. In <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, the segments
of the posterior cirri bear only two pairs of main spines;
whereas in some varieties of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, they carry
as many as ten <span class="correction" title="In the original book: pair">pairs</span> in a longitudinal row; but in this latter
species, the number of these spines varies, in a singular
manner, from six to ten pairs. In <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, the pairs of
spines on the segments of the posterior cirri are arranged
so closely one under the other, that they appear almost like
a single transverse row. Considering the whole family, the
third pair of cirri differs most in structure in the different
genera. Thus, in <a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>Chthamalus antennatus</i></a>, the anterior (or
outer) ramus (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f03">3</a>) is thicker and much longer
than the posterior (or inner) ramus; the number of the
segments in one instance being, in the two rami, 53 and 18;
in the longer ramus, the spines are arranged abnormally,
tending to form a little circle round each segment; and<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" href="#Page_84"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span></a>
the whole ramus may be said to be antenniformed, and I
believe acts as an organ of touch: the relative number of
the segments, I may add, in the two rami and the arrangement
of their spines varies greatly in this species. In two
other species of the same genus <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, we have
<em>occasionally</em> the anterior ramus in some degree antenniformed,
so that this whole structure is variable. In the
allied <a href="#Chamaesipho_columna"><i>Chamæsipho columna</i></a>, it is the posterior or inner
ramus which is antenniformed, but this peculiar development
is more plainly marked in the case of the second pair
of cirri than in that of the third pair. In <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a>
it is, also, the posterior ramus of the third pair which is
antenniformed; in this third pair, and indeed in the other
cirri, the relative numbers of the segments vary extremely.
A similar structure in the third pair, but in a lesser and
variable degree, may be observed in some of the other
species of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>. In <a href="#Balanus_vestitus"><i>Balanus vestitus</i></a>, also, we have, in
the third pair, an analogous structure. It is scarcely possible
to believe that the circumstance of the second pair of legs,
which answer to the third pair of cirri, being antenniformed
in certain decapod Crustaceans, is an accidental coincidence;
it must be owing to some special affinity in the two groups.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, the third pair of cirri is of unusual
length compared with the second pair, but does not otherwise
differ from the type of its sub-family: in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and
its allies, on the other hand, the third pair is very short and
broad, as may be seen (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f05">5</a>) in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>:
in this latter genus, the front surfaces of the segments of
the pedicels (fig. <a href="#p29f06">6</a>) of the posterior cirri, are extremely
protuberant, almost as in <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>.</p>

<p>The last peculiarity in the cirri at all worth mentioning,
is in the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: sub-genns">sub-genus</span> <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>, in which, differently from in all
other known Cirripedes, the anterior ramus of the fourth
pair does not absolutely resemble the rami of the fifth and
sixth pairs; in most of the species, the spines on this anterior
ramus are more crowded together, are larger, and are mingled
with some short thick points; and the spines in the dorsal
tufts are also longer than in the two posterior pairs of
cirri; but in <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f02">2</a>), and in a lesser
degree in <a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>A. cyathus</i></a> and <a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>A. purpurata</i></a>, the front margins of<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" href="#Page_85"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span></a>
the lower segments of this anterior ramus, and of the
upper segment of the pedicel, are developed into strong,
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: downwardly-curved">downwardly curved</span> teeth: it is very remarkable that so
beautiful a structure should be extremely variable, as it certainly
is in <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>Acasta sulcata</i></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="no-section">


<h3 class="center"><a name="Caudal_Appendages" id="Caudal_Appendages" /><i>Caudal Appendages.</i></h3>

<p>With extremely few exceptions,
these are present in all the Lepadidæ and <a href="#Family_Verrucidae">Verrucidæ</a>;
whereas amongst the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> they occur only in the two
species of <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, and in one species of <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>;
these being the genera most closely allied to the Lepadidæ,
and where, consequently, their presence might have been
anticipated. These appendages are seated close together
over the anus; they are multiarticulate, each segment
being sub-cylindrical, with a few small bristles round its
upper edge.</p>
</div>
<div class="no-section">


<h3 class="center"><a name="Alimentary_Canal" id="Alimentary_Canal" /><i>Alimentary Canal.</i></h3>

<p>I have not much on this head to add to what I have said
under the Lepadidæ. As in that family, the strong internal
membrane of the œsophagus terminates in a remarkable,
bell-shaped expansion (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f03">3</a>, <i>g′</i>), which, as observed
by M. St. Ange, serves to keep the upper broad end of the
stomach expanded. The œsophagus is well furnished with
constrictor and radiating muscles for closing and opening
it; and it is thus capable of a strong swallowing movement.
The stomach runs down to the lower end of the prosoma,
and then doubling back on itself extends to the anus. As
the prosoma is much elongated in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>,
so is the stomach of unusual length in these genera.
In several species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, the upper edge of the
stomach is surrounded by from six to eight cæca; these
cæca I ascertained, in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Balanus perforatus</i></a>, are branched, and
penetrate a considerable way into the body; and some of
them at least expand a little at their extremities. Each
cæcum, from the manner in which it retained fluid, must, I
think, be furnished, at the point where it enters the
stomach, with a sphincter muscle. In <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>,
<a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, there are no
cæca; but in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> and <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>Coronula balænaris</i></a>, there
are longitudinal, approximate folds in the upper, broad end<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" href="#Page_86"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span></a>
of the stomach, which would serve to expose the food to a
greater extent of digesting surface.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[37]</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> The presence and absence of these cæca in genera so closely allied as
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> and <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, shows, I think, that these cavities are not of high importance;
and I must doubt whether Von Siebold's view ('Anatomie Comparée,'
tom. i, p. 445), that these cæca form a passage to a true or isolated liver, such as
exists in the higher Crustacea, can be admitted. Cæca are said by Von Siebold
to occur in some of the Entomostraca, as Daphnia, Argulus, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>As in the case of the Lepadidæ, a transparent, structureless,
epithelial tube, composed of chitine, containing more
or less digested food, is found, in specimens preserved
in spirits, occupying the whole length of the stomach,
and where there are cæca, sending branched prolongations
into them. It does not extend into the œsophagus
or into the rectum. This epithelial tube or model of the
stomach, filled with excrement, is expelled by the rectum,
whole, that is in a single piece, as I observed in some living
specimens of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>: in some specimens, however,
of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>, the excrement was ejected, perhaps
from the animal being confined, in fragments, and the
sack thus became befouled. Beneath the epithelial layer,
the stomach is lined by a delicate, pulpy and cellular mucus
layer, which easily peels off in flakes: this is surrounded
by a muscular layer with the fibres closely approximated and
transverse; and this by a layer of stronger, longitudinal
muscles, but more distant from each other. Lastly, outside
this double muscular layer, there is a rather thick, somewhat
laminated, pulpy layer, abounding with cells, often nucleated,
and frequently containing much oily matter. This
structure agrees closely with Dr. C. H. Jones's<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[38]</span></a> account of
the external covering of the stomach in Daphnia, and which
he believes to be hepatic: as in Daphnia, there does not
seem to be any ducts. I may here observe, that within the
upper part of the prosoma, but not immediately connected
with the stomach, I have often observed much white pulpy
substance, permeated by lacunal passages, and exhibiting
no structure except some excessively minute cells.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> 'Philosophical Transactions,' 1849, p. 116. Karsten ('Nov. Actorum
Acad. Nat. Cur.,' 1845, tab. xx) has excellently figured the testes, as the
hepatic glands; and has indicated the ovaria as salivary glands; it is singular
that this anatomist overlooked the ducts which lead from his supposed hepatic
glands, into the vesiculæ seminales, within which he observed spermatozoa.</p>

<p><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" href="#Page_87"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span></a></p></div>

<p>The rectum, lined by membrane continuous with that
investing the thorax (and seen through it, in Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f08">8</a>, <i>c</i>),
extends inwards to about opposite the bases of the third or
fourth pairs of cirri. It is longitudinally plaited; the ends
of the folds forming a sort of valve where joined on to the
stomach. It is coated by circular, transverse muscular
fibres: judging from the movements, the anus itself is
surrounded by a strong sphincter muscle. The anus opens
on the dorsal surface of the thorax (fig. <a href="#p26f08">8</a>, <i>b</i>); but as in the
genera, in which caudal appendages occur, it opens under
them, the orifice, I believe, is homologically terminal, and
owes its dorsal aspect to the aborted state of the whole
abdomen, and to the great development of the probosciformed
penis; for the anus may be said to be situated on
the dorsal base of this organ.</p>

<p>Altogether we see that the alimentary canal is of a very
simple structure. The food, judging from the contents of
the stomach, seems generally to be composed of infusoria
and minute animals: but in the case of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, I have
been surprised at the size and number of the included
amphipod, isopod, and entomostracan Crustaceans, in one
case, together with an annelid. I have, also, sometimes
seen some confervoid matter within the stomach.</p>

<p>On this subject I can add nothing,
except to express my conviction that there is no heart, or true
vessels; the circulation being strictly lacunal. A passage has
often been quoted from Poli, in which he states that he saw a
pulsating organ, close above the anus; but I have seen this
movement, which appeared to me to be a convulsive twitching
of the sphincter muscle of this orifice. The largest
lacunal channel extends down the middle of the rostral
compartment of the shell: and this answers to the rostral
channel down the peduncle in the Lepadidæ. Large
nerves and the main pair of unbranched ovarian tubes
(Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, leading into <i>g</i>) extend along this channel.
At the basis (at least in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>) this channel joins on to
a large circular one, running all round the sack, and sending
off branches into the mass of ovarian tubes and cæca.</p>

<p>It has been shown in my former volume, that in Lepas
and in some other genera of the Lepadidæ, there are six
main ganglions; one supra-œsophageal, and five infra-œsophageal,
or thoracic. In Pollicipes, however, there are
only four thoracic ganglions, the last ganglion supplying the
three posterior pairs of cirri with nerves, whereas in the
other genera, the last ganglion supplies only the fifth and
sixth pairs of cirri. In this genus, moreover, the lateral
fusion of the ganglions has been so complete, that there is
no evidence of their having been formed by the union of
two. Amongst sessile cirripedes, we discover evidence of
much higher concentration even than in Pollicipes. My
chief examination has been confined to <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a>,
and to <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>: and in these genera we find
(and the fact appears to me highly remarkable) as high a
degree of concentration in the infra-œsophageal ganglion
as in any decapod Crustacean, for instance, as in Maia,
judging from the figure given by Milne Edwards; for all
the nerves, with the exception of those connected with the
supra-œsophageal ganglions, radiate from a single great
ganglion.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[39]</span></a> The nervous system is, moreover, otherwise
complicated.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> It must, however, be observed that, according to Mr. Dana, there is
in certain suctorial Entomostracans, as in Caligus, only one infra-œsophageal
ganglion. Mr. Dana speaks of this as resulting from reduction. In Cirripedes,
from the gradation which may be observed from Lepas through Pollicipes into
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, the ganglions are certainly not reduced but concentrated. In Van de
Hoeven's figure of the nervous system in Limulus, there is seen to be no chain
of thoracic ganglions; all the nerves rising from the circa-œsophageal collar;
but this, on the other hand, seems hardly developed into a ganglion.</p></div>

<p>To begin with <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a> the great infra-œsophageal
ganglion (Pl. <a href="#Page_711">27</a>, fig. <a href="#p27f01">1</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>) is seated nearly opposite to
the anterior margin of the second pair of cirri, which are homologous
with the first pair of legs in the decapod Crustaceans.
This ganglion shows no trace of any longitudinal medial
suture; its shape is hardly discoverable, for it is formed
by the union of eleven principal pairs of nerves, besides<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" href="#Page_89"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span></a>
several arising from its under surface; in outline, however,
it may be said to be divided into a posterior and anterior
half; the latter being somewhat heart-shaped, and the
posterior half elongated. The nerves going to the five
posterior pairs of cirri rise from the posterior margin of the
ganglion, and run for some distance in a sheet, parallel and
close together; the pair, however, going to the second pair
of cirri soon branches off from the others. Each of these
nerves enters at the inner and posterior margin of the cirrus
to which it belongs, and, at least in the case of the first pair,
divides into two branches as it enters. The nerves (Pl. <a href="#Page_711">27</a>,
fig. <a href="#p27f01">1</a>, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: r 5"><i>r<sup>5</sup></i></span>, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: r 6"><i>r<sup>6</sup></i></span>) going to the fifth and sixth pairs of cirri are
more closely united together than are the others, and
appear, till they branch off, like a single large nerve. That
which belongs to the sixth cirrus gives off, opposite to the
fifth cirrus, a branch (<i>s</i>) nearly as large as itself, which enters
the probosciformed penis. I may remark, that homologically
this is the only abdominal nerve in any cirripede of
the Order. From the under side of the nerves which run
to the five posterior pairs of cirri, small branches are given
off, extending dorsally into the thorax.</p>

<p>The anterior end of the great infra-œsophageal ganglion
is formed by the union of a set of nerves, extending parallel
in a bundle in a directly opposite direction to those running
to the five posterior pairs of cirri. These nerves consist of an
outer larger pair (<span class="correction" title="In the original book: r 1"><i>r<sup>1</sup></i></span>) entering the first pair of cirri; and
within these, and rather dorsally to their roots, we have the
circa-œsophageal chord (<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>), or collar nerve; between the
roots of the latter, and on the ventral surface (or near side
of the figure), there are three closely united, small pairs,
running to the gnathites, and, as I believe, to the olfactory
sacks. From the under (or dorsal) surface of the anterior
end of the ganglion, two nerves, larger even than the circa-œsophageal
chord, and which I shall call the splanchnic pair
(<i>d</i>, <i>d</i>) arise; and the singular course of these nerves will presently
be described; between this great pair, there is a
single (<i>b</i>) medial nerve, which runs down and branches into
that large diverging muscle, which is attached to the upper
ventral surface of the stomach. Posteriorly to these three
nerves, we have two pairs of much smaller nerves (not<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" href="#Page_90"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span></a>
figured), running dorsally into the body, so that we have
seven nerves rising from the under surface of the infra-œsophageal
ganglion. I need only further add, that on
each side of this ganglion, between the nerves going to the
first and second pairs of cirri, there is a moderately sized
nerve (<i>k</i>), which appeared to run into the muscles of the
thorax: a nerve in a similar position is figured by Milne
Edwards in Maia.</p>

<p>The circa-œsophageal chord (<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>) nearly equals in length
the whole distance from the centre of the main ganglion to
the posterior end of the thorax. This collar bows out on each
side, where passing the œsophagus (<i>œ</i>), which is seated at its
anterior end. From the collar a branch is given off on
each side, which I traced as far as between the mandibles
and maxillæ; from analogy with other Crustaceans, it
perhaps runs to the mandibles. The collar has not a
transverse commissure, such as described by Milne Edwards
in the Podophthalmia, and as figured by Van de Hoeven in
Limulus.</p>

<p>The supra-œsophageal ganglions (<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>) present a singular
contrast with the infra-œsophageal ganglion in their little
development, size, or degree of confluence. They lie directly
under the basal edge of the labrum. They are
laterally quite distinct, and consist merely of a slight enlargement
of the circa-œsophageal chord. From the anterior
edge of each ganglion, a broad nerve (<i>f</i>) extends for
some distance in a straight line, and, on close examination,
can be seen to be formed of two nerves closely united, of
which the inner and smaller one, after a space, appears to
cross over the larger nerve: both become at this point
tortuous, and, giving off branches (<i>m</i>, <i>m</i>), form a plexus.
The two nerves (<i>f</i>) then bend inwards, and almost
touching each other, run down, together with the two
ovarian simple ducts, along the rostral compartment of the
shell. No doubt, if the smaller branches from these nerves
could be traced, they would be seen to form a network over
the whole sack; and would therefore enclose, as in a cage,
the rest of the nervous system. These nerves correspond, I
believe, to the two pair of antennular nerves of ordinary
Crustaceans, and hence I will call them by this name.<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" href="#Page_91"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span></a>
Just in front, at the outside corners of the two supra-œsophageal
ganglions (<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>), a branch (<i>e′</i>) arises, which I
traced to the ends of the adductor scutorum muscle, and to
those several muscles which serve to retract the interspace
of membrane between the mouth and the adductor.</p>

<p>The pair of great splanchnic nerves above alluded to,
which arise from the anterior and dorsal surface of the
infra-œsophageal ganglion, are in Pl. <a href="#Page_711">27</a>, fig. <a href="#p27f01">1</a>, <i>d</i> <i>d</i>, (and
in fig. <a href="#p27f02">2</a>), laid flat; but in nature they first bow outwards, and
then, penetrating deeper into the body, approach each other,
and running nearly parallel, pass round the lower end of
the œsophagus: their course consequently is nearly similar
to that of the circa-œsophageal chord, with this difference,
that the outwardly bowed portion is situated near the infra-œsophageal,
instead of near the supra-œsophageal ganglion.
The splanchnic nerve, a little beyond the supra-œsophageal
ganglion, joins a plexus (<i>d′</i>); and into this plexus another
large nerve (<i>e</i>) which I will call the supra-splanchnic nerve,
sends branches; this nerve takes an almost semicircular
bend over the ovarian glands. The supra-splanchnic nerves
(<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>), though appearing to spring from the supra-œsophageal
ganglions, do really arise, as may be seen by tracing the constituent
fibres, from the circa-œsophageal chord. The plexus
(<i>d′</i>) lies close to the coats of the upper end of the stomach:
several branches, proceeding from it, run further on, but I
was able to trace only a few of them: one went (at least in
the case of <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Balanus perforatus</i></a>), to the adductor scutorum
muscle: another branch spread out on the flanks of the
prosoma: I strongly suspect that one branch goes to the
acoustic sack: it appeared, also, as if some of the small
branches entered the second plexus (<i>m</i>), where the inner
antennular nerve and ophthalmic nerve cross over the outer
antennular nerve.</p>

<p>I have called the nerves (<i>dd</i>, <i>ee</i>) splanchnic and supra-splanchnic,
from their course and apparent function in
supplying the viscera. In the descriptions of the nervous
system of other Crustaceans I can find nothing analogous
to my great splanchnic nerve (<i>dd</i>); the so-called supra-splanchnic
nerves (<i>ee</i>), which arise from the circa-œsophageal
chord, seem to be the analogues of the ordinary splanchnic<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" href="#Page_92"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span></a>
nerves, though these latter are always described as uniting
into a single medial branch. The plexus (<i>d′</i>) is the cervical
ganglion of M. Martin St. Ange,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[40]</span></a> who has likewise indicated
the course of my splanchnic and supra-splanchnic
nerves; but the plexus, when viewed as a transparent
object, hardly appears to me to be ganglionic in its nature.
In my former volume on the Lepadidæ, I quite misunderstood
the course of these splanchnic nerves.</p>

<p>From the commissure between the two supra-œsophageal
ganglions, a straight chord (Pl. <a href="#Page_711">27</a>, fig. <a href="#p27f01">1</a>, <i>g</i>) arises, which
terminates in a small ganglion (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>), barely exhibiting traces of
being formed of two laterally confluent ganglions. This is the
ophthalmic ganglion. The chord connecting it with the two
supra-œsophageal ganglions is accompanied by a small nerve
(<i>h</i>) which runs on to the muscles round the adductor scutorum
muscle; the chord is encased by much fibrous tissue, and its
dissection is thereby rendered difficult. From the ophthalmic
ganglion, on each side, a nerve (<i>i</i>) goes forth and crosses
the antennular nerve; these, if I could have traced them,
would have been found to run, as may be safely inferred
from what is known in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>, to a pair
(<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>) of eyes.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>, the structure of the great infra-œsophageal
ganglion (Pl. <a href="#Page_711">27</a>, fig. <a href="#p27f02">2</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>) is essentially the same
as described under <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. The great pair of splanchnic
nerves springing from its under side, are here actually twice
as large as the circa-œsophageal chord. The plexus (<i>d′</i>)
formed by the splanchnic nerve (<i>d</i>), on each side, with the
supra-splanchnic nerve (<i>e</i>), which arises close posteriorly to
the supra-œsophageal ganglion, is here much less complicated,
but is perfectly distinct; and there was no appearance
of the cervical ganglion of M. Martin St. Ange. The
chord (<i>g</i>) running from between the two supra-œsophageal
ganglions to the ophthalmic ganglion, is nearly as large as
the double antennular nerve (<i>f</i>) on each side of it. The
ophthalmic chord (which is accompanied in its whole course
by a small branch running to the adductor scutorum muscle)
terminates in a small ophthalmic ganglion (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>), which seems<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" href="#Page_93"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span></a>
to be formed by the almost complete fusion of two ganglions.
This ganglion is hardly larger than the chord which it terminates:
it appeared to me to give rise to more than one
pair of nerves, and a single nerve (to my surprise) joined
the branch just mentioned, which goes to the adductor
scutorum muscle.</p>

<p>From each supra-œsophageal ganglion, two closely united
antennular nerves (<i>f</i>) extend, of which the inner one crosses
over the main or exterior nerve, nearly opposite to the
ophthalmic ganglion, and here forms (<i>m</i>) a plexus. The
structure of this plexus I was not able, any more than in
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, to make out thoroughly, but I traced quite distinctly
a long nerve (<i>i</i>) running from it into what must be
considered as the eye. As in the case of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, I traced
a nerve on each side from the ophthalmic ganglion into the
plexus, where I lost it; and as here in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, I saw on
each side of the ophthalmic ganglion a cut off nerve, of
about the size of that which runs from the plexus on
each side into the eye, I think we may safely conclude that
the latter or optic nerve does really arise from the ganglion
here called ophthalmic. I may add that the analogy of the
nervous system in the Lepadidæ most strongly confirms
the view of this latter being the ophthalmic ganglion.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Eyes_and_Vision" id="Eyes_and_Vision" /><span class="correction" title="In the original book, this title was in the TOC but not in the text."><i>Eyes and Vision.</i></span></h3>

<p>The optic nerve (<i>i</i>), running from the plexus to the eye, is
of considerable size; it runs nearly parallel to the main antennular
nerve, diverging from it a little. It retains nearly
the same diameter throughout; and gives off only one
single, small, inner branch. It can be traced beyond the
basal edges of the scuta, to just under the upper edge of the
transparent opercular membrane, which unites the scuta to
the sheath of the rostrum. The nerve itself, at a little distance
from its further end, was, in a full-sized specimen, 5/1000ths
of an inch in diameter; widening a little, it expands slightly,
and abruptly terminates in a circular disc, about 8/1000ths of
an inch in diameter, (see Pl. <a href="#Page_711">27</a>, fig. <a href="#p27f05">5</a>). The nerve just
beneath this slight expansion, is coated all round by pellets of
dark purple pigment-cells, but not actually united into a continuous
layer. These pigment-cells are the more conspicuous
from the surrounding parts being colourless. I could not
make out distinctly any cornea; and I suppose the external<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" href="#Page_94"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span></a>
transparent membrane, to which the above slight circular
expansion is attached, acts as such. This description very
closely agrees with that given of these organs in <i>Bal. rugosus</i>
of Gould, (<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>?) by Dr. Leidy,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[41]</span></a> who first discovered
the eye in the adult cirripede, but he did not
observe the ophthalmic ganglion. These eyes differ from
those in some of the genera of the Lepadidæ, only in the
greater length of the optic nerve, and by standing laterally
further apart from each other.</p>

I may add that I have, also, observed the supra-œsophageal and ophthalmic
ganglions in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Bal. perforatus</i></a>.</p></div>

<p>I may here mention that I tried a few simple experiments
on the senses of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>,
and <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>. I found these three species very
sensitive to shadows, that is, to an object like my hand
passing even quickly, and at the distance of about a foot,
between them and the source of the light.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[42]</span></a> They were indifferent
to a gradual change from bright to obscure
light; but instantly perceived and drew in their cirri, when
my hand was passed between the basin in which they were
kept and the window, even when this was tried rather late
on a dusky evening; and likewise when my hand was passed
between them and a single candle. I took, of course, the
precaution of passing my hand in other directions, but this
never produced any effect. These species are moderately
sensible to any vibration in the vessel in which they were
kept, but they were indifferent to noises made in the
air, or in the water. I found it impossible to touch, under
water, an individual shell ever so lightly with a needle,
without all the immediately surrounding individuals, when
several adhered together, perceiving it, and retracting their
cirri: it made no difference whether the one touched had
already withdrawn its cirri and was motionless: from this
fact, and from seeing that a similar but slighter effect
was produced by touching the rock on which the specimens
adhered, I infer that the perception by the others of
the one being touched, is communicated by vibration.<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" href="#Page_95"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span></a>
When an individual was touched under water, not by a
needle, but by a pointed camel-hair brush, it generally
withdrew its cirri, but the neighbouring specimens took no
notice: when touched by a single hair of the brush, no
notice was taken, unless the skin of the orifice leading
into the sack was so touched. In these trials, it is of
course necessary carefully to avoid intercepting the light.
I could not make out that cirripedes perceived odours
diffused in the water.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Acoustic_Organs" id="Acoustic_Organs" /><i>Acoustic Organs.</i></h3>

<p>These are situated in the same position
as in the Lepadidæ, namely, in a slight swelling on the sides
of the thorax (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, <i>d′</i>) just beneath the basal articulation
of the first pair of cirri. The orifice in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>
and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> is slightly produced, or is tubular; the
free part in the former genus projecting 5/100ths of an inch.
The structure of all the parts is essentially the same as in the
Lepadidæ, but I think all are proportionally larger. The
external membrane of the body is turned inwards at the
orifice, as a short flattened tube, which widens considerably
(being, in a middle-sized specimen of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, 4/100ths of an
inch in width) before it abruptly terminates. The meatus,
as I have called the sack-like cavity which encloses the true
acoustic sack or vesicle, is formed of pulpy membrane, and
is apparently continuous with the corium of the whole
body, but by dissection it can be separated entire. The
acoustic vesicle is of various shapes, as we shall immediately
see; but in all essential respects it is identical with the
same part in the Lepadidæ; it is formed of the same peculiar,
soft, elastic, brownish, transparent tissue, which seems
to be composed of fine, transverse pillars, becoming towards
the outside fibrous, and at their inner ends appearing when
viewed vertically from above, like hyaline points. In
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a>, I observed on the outside of the acoustic
vesicle, some excessively minute bristles, only 1/3000ths of an
inch in length, seated on little eminences. I examined
carefully the contents of the vesicle in this species, in specimens
well preserved in spirits, and there was nothing
within but a very little, thin, pulpy fluid, and a few
yellowish nucleated cells, here and there aggregated into
small groups. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, the flattened acoustic vesicle is<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" href="#Page_96"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span></a>
elongated, with a somewhat sinuous, but not very irregular
margin (Pl. <a href="#Page_711">27</a>, fig. <a href="#p27f04">4</a>), and is without any ridges on the
surface; its neck or orifice projects at right angles to the
elongated portion, which stands obliquely to the tubular
orifice of the meatus. In a moderately-sized specimen of
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a>, the elongated portion of the acoustic
vesicle was, 6/100ths of an inch in length. In <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, the
acoustic vesicle is heart-shaped, with the neck attached to
its broader end; and the surface is covered by zig-zag
ridges. In <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a> (fig. <a href="#p27f03">3</a>), the acoustic
vesicle is almost square at the lower end, with the neck
placed at one of the upper corners; on the external surface,
there is an oblique prominent ridge or fold, which sends off
downwards another ridge; its length, in a large individual,
was 5/100ths of an inch.</p>

<p>In all these cases, the acoustic vesicle is mainly attached
by its neck, to the upper end of the sack-like meatus;
but there is likewise a layer of soft, pulpy, cellular matter,
slightly connecting that side of the vesicle which is opposite
to the neck, with the walls of the meatus or outer sack.
The mouth or orifice of the vesicle is closed by a delicate
lid or diaphragm, which can easily be separated; and this
diaphragm is formed by the expansion of a large nerve,
which here abruptly terminates. In a very large specimen
of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a> I clearly made out the existence of
this nerve, and traced its course for some distance from the
point where the summit of the meatus and the neck of the
vesicle are joined together; the nerve first runs posteriorly,
and then turns inwards and doubles back or anteriorly; and I
clearly followed it to the antero-lateral sides of the uppermost
end of the stomach, where it seemed to enter a ganglion,
so that I unfortunately cut it off, but found only a
slight plexus, with the cut off nerve apparently running
onwards with nearly the same diameter. The diameter is
great, fully equalling, in its widest part, that of the circa-œsophageal
chord; but it is very much flattened, and so has
not nearly so much bulk as that nerve. Before it reached
the stomach, it gave off one branch, which ran towards the
mouth. The only nerves which, from their size, could, I
think, be continuous with this from the acoustic sack, are<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" href="#Page_97"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span></a>
the main branches proceeding from that plexus (<i>d′</i>) formed
by the interbranching of the splanchnic and supra-splanchnic
nerves.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[43]</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> I have always feared that anatomists would reject my view of these organs
being acoustic, owing to the absence of otolithes; but I observe that so high an
authority as Von Siebold ('Anatomie Comparée,' tom. i, p. 433) does not
believe that otolithes occur in the acoustic organs even of the highest Crustacea.
He considers an "ampoule volumineuse, a parois mince, remplie d'un liquide
transparent," and a "membrane tympanique," though having a fissure in the
centre, as sufficient. I may here remark, that the nerve proceeding from the
acoustic vesicle in Cirripedes, and apparently running to the splanchnic nerve,
may easily be placed in connexion with the antennular nerves, by the second
plexus (<i>m</i>) in figs. <a href="#p27f01">1</a> and <a href="#p27f02">2</a>, pl. <a href="#Page_711">27</a>. I should infer from Von Siebold's remarks
on his ampoule volumineuse in the higher Crustacea, that my acoustic vesicle
answered to the labyrinth in higher animals.</p></div>

<p>I can add nothing to the account given
of these organs under the Lepadidæ: I saw them in all the
genera which I examined for this object. In <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula

position (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f04">4</a>, <i>n</i>), in the confluent segments, beneath
the free part of the outer maxillæ, and somewhat exteriorly,
or as near as possible to the inner maxillæ. In no sessile
cirripede are the orifices produced or tubular, as is the
case with several genera amongst the Lepadidæ. I failed,
as heretofore, in tracing with certainty the nerve, which
appears to enter the base of the sack, to its ganglion.</p>

<p>All the Cirripedes of the family we are
now describing, are bisexual or hermaphrodite; and no
instance has been observed of the presence of males or
complemental males. I have very little to add to the observations
made by M. Martin St. Ange and R. Wagner,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[44]</span></a>
and to those given in my former volume. The testes seem
always to be confined to within the thorax, including the
prosoma. With their ducts, they resemble club-moss or<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" href="#Page_98"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span></a>
stag's horns, with the extremities a little enlarged: a figure<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[45]</span></a>
of a small portion from <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Balanus perforatus</i></a> is given in
Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f02">2</a>. It is quite surprising how like in structure
and appearance the branching ovarian tubes often are
to the testes with their ducts; but the latter are of smaller
diameter. Two main ducts generally unite just before
entering the broad, often reflexed, end of the vesicula
seminalis: in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>Coronula balænaris</i></a>, however, I observed four
ducts entering this receptacle. The two vesiculæ seminales,
lying within the thorax and prosoma, are usually very long
and tortuous: they are formed of a thin inner tunic, which
is strengthened by thicker reticulated lines, and of an outer
layer of transverse fibres, which are either elastic, or probably
muscular, as they serve to expel the contents with force when
the end is cut off. The inner tunic is prolonged up the
probosciformed penis, at the base of which the two vesiculæ
unite.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[46]</span></a> The contents of the vesiculæ are commonly pulpy
and cellular; and from the cells the spermatozoa are developed;
soon after their development, they are, as it appears,
expelled.</p>

<p>I have seen the spermatozoa in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>Balanus crenatus</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>perforatus</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>balanoides</i></a>, and in <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>.
The cells, from which the spermatozoa are developed, and
which are often found in vast numbers within the vesiculæ,
are on an average about 1/5000th of an inch in diameter. The
spermatozoa differ remarkably within the vesicula of the
same individual, according to their state of development. I
have observed in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a> and in the <span class="correction" title="In the original book, this word was italicized."><a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a></span>, that
the shortest, and therefore, I presume, the youngest (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>,
fig. <a href="#p29f07">7</a>, <i>a</i>), had a globular head with no projection in front: as
they increased in size, this head became less in diameter,
and a short tapering filament, (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,) like the tail, projected
out of it. This anterior filament does not lie in exactly the
same line with the posterior filament, which is straight as an
arrow. In <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>Bal. crenatus</i></a>, the anterior filament was 1/2000th of
an inch in length, and the posterior filament 4/2000th, giving a<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" href="#Page_99"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span></a>
total length of 5/2000th: in the longest and best developed
specimens of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>, the nodular enlargement
was much elongated and spindle-shaped, and not above
half the diameter it had in the earliest stage; the posterior
filament (measured from the front of the enlargement, this
consequently being included) was 5/2000th in length, and the
front part only 1/4000th, giving a total length of 11/4000ths of an
inch. These observations agree pretty well with Kölliker's;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[47]</span></a>
but this author states, that perfectly developed spermatozoa
are absolutely without any nodular enlargement: if this
be the case, I have never chanced to see the spermatozoa in
their perfect condition. Mr. Bate, also, figures some (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>,

<p>The probosciformed penis lies adpressed on the under side
of the thorax, with its apex generally projecting between the
first and second pairs of cirri. It presents the same ringed or
articulated structure as in the Lepadidæ: it arises from an
unarticulated projection or support, which also forms the
posterior border to the anus. This support often terminates,
as first observed by Poli, in a very sharp point; but this
point cannot be of much functional importance, for though
present in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, it is absent in the closely
allied <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>; in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> there is only a rudiment
of this point; I have not observed it in any member of the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>. The strong, transverse and longitudinal
muscles with which the penis is furnished, are attached to
this support. The apex or orifice of the penis is, I believe,
invariably surrounded by some bristles. Its length varies
much, according to its state of contraction or relaxation;
and this again, I believe, is dependent on the condition of the
male secreting organs. In a small specimen of <a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>Elminius
modestus</i></a>, the penis was actually thrice as long as the whole
thorax, including the prosoma: in <span class="correction" title="In the original book, this word was italicized."><a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a></span> and in
<a href="#Octomeris_angulosa"><i>Octomeris angulosa</i></a>, the penis is very short, being equal only
to once and a half the length of the pedicel of the sixth<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" href="#Page_100"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span></a>
cirrus: in <a href="#Octomeris_brunnea"><i>Octomeris brunnea</i></a>, the unarticulated support is
much elongated, being as long as the pedicel of the sixth
cirrus, in which respect this organ resembles that of <i>Ibla
quadrivalvis</i>, and of no other Cirripede. From the attachment
of the penis at the posterior end and on the under side
of the anus—from the position of the caudal appendages
(where such occur) over the anus—from the position of
these same appendages in the pupa—and lastly, from the
position of the papilla-like penis in the abnormal <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta"><i>Proteolepas</i></a>,
I infer that, homologically, the penis is situated at the apex
of the abdomen, on its ventral surface; and that, consequently,
this organ cannot be considered as the abdomen
itself in a modified condition.</p>

<p>I have scarcely anything to add to the
statements in my former volume. These organs consist of
the true ovaria, or glandular bodies seated on each side, not
far from the basal edge of the labrum; of the main or unbranched
ovarian ducts; and of the (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, <i>g</i>) ovarian
branching tubes and cæca. I traced distinctly in <span class="correction" title="In the original book, this word was italicized."><a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a></span>,
<span class="correction" title="In the original book, this word was italicized."><a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a></span>, and
<span class="correction" title="In the original book, this word was italicized."><a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a></span>, the two main ovarian ducts,
running from within the prosoma to the layer of inosculating,
branching, ovarian cæca<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[48]</span></a> which overlie the basis. In
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a> one of these main ducts was 1/100th of an inch
in diameter. Though I traced these ducts near to the grape-like,
glandular masses,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[49]</span></a> which I cannot doubt are the true
ovaria, I did not succeed in tracing them into actual connection.
As in the Lepadidæ, these ovarian glands lie on
the sides, near the basal margin of the labrum, and almost
under, but rather to the outside of the antennular nerves.
The branching and inosculating ovarian cæca form a layer,
which corresponds with the mass filling up the peduncle in
the Lepadidæ. In <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> they do not cover the whole
basis, but are confined to the circumference; they, however,<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" href="#Page_101"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span></a>
likewise extend up between the two layers of corium round
the walls of the shell, and chiefly in the interspaces between
the depressor muscles of the opercular valves. In
<a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, they enter between the radiating septa in the
thickness of the walls: in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a>, they extend
from over the basal membrane into the six large square
chambers (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>, <i>v</i>) separating the radii and alæ: in
<a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> they are confined to the basis: in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>,
they form a layer over the basis and likewise round the upper
part of the peduncle-like body, which answers to the shell of
other sessile cirripedes.</p>

positively recognised in any Crustacean.</p></div>

<p>As after the most careful and repeated examinations of
various Lepadidæ, I was convinced that there were no oviducts,
so I have come to a similar conclusion in regard to
the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>; the ova being brought to the surface, by the
formation of a new membrane round the sack underneath
them, and by the subsequent exuviation of the old membrane.
The ova are united together by a most delicate
tunic investing each egg; the ovigerous lamellæ being thus
formed, as in the Lepadidæ. In the cases of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus
stellatus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, and <a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>Platylepas decorata</i></a>, I saw
a pair of very distinct but fragile lamellæ. In <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>,
the two ovigerous lamellæ form two sub-cylindrical packets,
pointed at their lower ends and often cohering. There are
no ovigerous fræna, for the attachment of the lamellæ; the
ova being sufficiently well retained, as it would appear, by
the well-closed shell. I have elsewhere stated my full belief
that it is the ovigerous fræna which have been metamorphosed
into the branchiæ of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>. Most sessile
cirripedes breed when very young; and I have every reason
to believe that they breed several times in the year. The
ova are ovate, and vary in length from 14/2000th of an inch in
<a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, to 19/2000th in some species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, in which
this greater length was owing to a more elongated shape,—up
to 25/2000th in some other species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The ova
are wonderfully numerous, especially in the genus <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>.</p>

<p>I may here mention the singular case of some elongated
specimens of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, from Tenby, in South
Wales: some of these presented nothing abnormal; but in
no less than seven specimens, the two, three, or four poste<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" href="#Page_102"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span></a>rior
pairs of cirri, either on one or both sides, were in an
almost rudimentary condition, being of small size and
having a shrunk and wasted appearance. In six out of
these seven specimens, the probosciformed penis was quite
short and abruptly truncated, as if from abortion. By
cutting off the truncated apex, and cleaning the external
tissue, I ascertained that it was imperforate, apparently in
all the cases, and I am certain of this fact in several of the
cases. In three of the specimens, I examined the vesiculæ
seminales; in one, I found some spermatozoa, but cohering
together in a peculiar manner; in the second, there were no
spermatozoa; and in the third, the vesiculæ were shrunk,
empty, and quite rudimentary in size. So that these three
individuals certainly could not have impregnated their own
eggs; nevertheless, within the shell of these very three, there
were perfectly developed larvæ: I am led to conclude from
this fact, that adjoining specimens in a perfect condition had,
by means of their long probosciformed penis, effected the
fecundation of their imperfect neighbours. I need only
further add, that some out of the above six specimens, with
more or less aborted cirri and imperforate male organs,
were infested by a peculiar parasite, allied to Bopyrus,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[50]</span></a>
and that these specimens did not contain ova.</p>

<p>In my former volume, the metamorphoses were described
under three principal stages or heads; but whether these
three included all the main changes, I was then hardly able
to conjecture. But now I have reason to believe that such
is the case, for in the genus <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, belonging to
the <a href="#Order_Abdominalia">Abdominalia</a>, the whole course of the metamorphosis,
from the egg to the pupa, takes place within the sack of the
parent; and I found, when having, on the coast of South
America, numerous specimens to examine, that the egg-like
larvæ (Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f15">15</a>-<a href="#p24f18">18</a>) could be naturally grouped into<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" href="#Page_103"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span></a>
two main stages, but with many transitional intermediate
grades (answering to the successive moults in the first
stage of ordinary larvæ), before they passed into the third
or pupal stage. And the first two stages in these egg-like
larvæ of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, clearly seem to correspond with
the first two stages in ordinary larvæ; for in both the
chief changes are, the shortening of the terminal projection—the
increase in size and approximation on the ventral
surface of the anterior horns or cases for the antennæ—and
the compression of the whole body. In all members of
the <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>, the metamorphosis seems to run a remarkably
uniform course. The larva in the first stage undergoes
several moults and slighter changes—how many is not
known—before arriving at its second main stage, which
has been observed only in one single instance; and judging
from <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, this second stage passes abruptly by
one moult into the pupal stage; and this, certainly, passes
abruptly into the Cirripedial or mature stage.</p>

difference—hardly any difference which could be

(Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f08">8</a>), a view of the larva, in the first stage before

from that just referred to (fig. <a href="#p29f09">9</a>), of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, but is
rather more fully developed. These drawings suffice to show
the character of the larvæ in the first stage, both before and
after the first moult, and even after the second moult,
throughout the Order of <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>. The larvæ sometimes
undergo their first moult within the sack of their
parent, as I have been informed by Mr. Bate, and as I have
observed in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>.</p>

Plates 6, 7, and 8.</p></div>

<p>I will now make a few remarks on these larvæ in the
first stage, before and after the first moult, supplemental to
those in my former volume. Their shape is oval, and the
whole dorsal surface is evidently covered by a carapace. It
is remarkable that the body exhibits no distinct articulations;
those given by Goodsir<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[52]</span></a> being certainly erroneous.
Commencing at the anterior extremity, the eye varies considerably
in the state of its development; in <a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>Platylepas decorata</i></a>
it is nearly circular, and in most of the specimens
very distinct; whereas in the allied <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>Coronula balænaris</i></a>,
before the first moult, it is very imperfect, but afterwards
square and of considerable size. In <a href="#Balanus_galeatus"><i>Balanus</i> <span class="correction" title="Darwin's errata changed from: elongatus"><i>galeatus</i></span></a>, in
the immature larvæ dissected out of the egg, the cellular
matter which was in process of conversion into the eye,
formed a transverse band, obscurely divided into two portions,
and this seems to indicate that the single eye is in
fact formed by the confluence of two eyes. In <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>,
this heart-shaped eye lies between a V-shaped muscle,
the nature of which I cannot understand, and which has not
been represented in (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f08">8</a>, <i>a</i>). I need only further
add, that in <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>, after the first moult, the
eye exhibits, in specimens sent me by Mr. Bate, some appearance
of tending to become double.</p>

<p>Arising posteriorly to the eye, we see, in <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Scalpellam"><i>Scalpellum</i></span> <i>vulgare</i>,
a pair of minute curved horns (<i>b′</i>), directed back<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" href="#Page_105"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span></a>wards;

probably could not be made out previously to the first moult,
in any larva of less size than that of <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>.
But after the first moult, Mr. Bate has seen, in two species
of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, in <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> and in <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> (fig. <a href="#p29f10">10</a>, <i>b</i>), a pair
of articulated organs, in this same position, evidently now
forming antennæ, and directed anteriorly, and free from any
envelope. It is somewhat important, as we shall presently
see, to bear in mind that these antennæ first appear within
an envelope or horn; and that I detected that they included
an articulated organ, before I had heard of Mr. Bate's observations.
These antennæ, from their small size, from being
seated internally with respect to the horns containing the
other pair of antennæ, and from the position which the latter
assume in the later stages of the larva, I believe to be the
first or anterior pair. Their position in appearance posteriorly
to the large lateral horns, containing the second pair
of antennæ, is probably due to the anterior cephalic segments
having been driven inwards, the truncated outline
of the front of the head, and likewise, probably, the position
of the mouth between the bases of the natatory legs being
thus caused.</p>

<p>In this same larva of <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>, within the great
lateral horns just alluded to (fig. <a href="#p29f08">8</a>, <i>c</i>), filiform organs, supporting
rows of spines, could be distinguished; and these appeared
to me to be antennæ. These horns or cases resemble in
structure the smaller pair just described; they arise from
the ventral surface, and can hardly, therefore, be considered
as prolongations of the carapace. After the first moult
(fig. <a href="#p29f10">10</a>, <i>c</i>) they are seen to have increased much in length:
in some cases they are of considerable length before the first
moult, as in Lepas: in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> they seem to be generally
shorter than in the Lepadidæ; but in <a href="#Balanus_galeatus"><i>Balanus</i> <span class="correction" title="Darwin's errata changed from: elongatus"><i>galeatus</i></span></a>
I found them one third of the entire length of the
animal. Whilst within the egg, these horns are adpressed
laterally to the body, and so point posteriorly; afterwards
they project rectangularly from the sides, or, as in <i>Scalpellum
vulgare</i>, are directed somewhat anteriorly. As in
the larvæ of all ordinary Crustaceans, as yet known, the an<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" href="#Page_106"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span></a>tennæ
are amongst the earliest developed organs; and as
the first pair of natatory legs (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, figs. <a href="#p29f08">8</a>-<a href="#p29f10">10</a>, <i>e</i>) in
these Cirripedial larvæ, might so very naturally be thought
to be antennæ (as has been remarked to me by Mr. Dana),
both from their structure and from their position a little
anteriorly to the mouth, I am well aware that to prove my
view correct, namely, that these horns are the second pair
of antennæ in process of formation, it is not sufficient merely
to have seen organs resembling antennæ within them; nor
is it sufficient to advance the strictly analogical fact of the
first-mentioned pair of antennæ, which in Scalpellum indisputably
appear in their earliest condition within an envelope
or horn. Further evidence is required, and this is
presented in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, in which the lateral horns of
the egg-like larva, in its first stage (Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f16">16</a>), can be
actually followed step by step until, in the second stage
(fig. <a href="#p24f17">17</a>), just before passing into the pupa, the horns are
seen to have become larger and more nearly approximated
to each other on the ventral surface; and whilst in this condition,
I several times dissected out the prehensile antennæ
of the future pupa with <em>every character perfectly recognisable</em>.
Hence I cannot doubt that in the larvæ of Cirripedes the
law of development is, that in their very earliest condition, the
small first pair of antennæ are enclosed in cases; and that
the large second pair <span class="correction" title="In the original book: remain">remains</span> thus enveloped until the pupal
stage. This conclusion, we shall immediately see, is in
harmony with the late development of the succeeding
appendages or organs of the mouth, which certainly do not
appear in the first larval stage, and are not known to
appear even till after the final metamorphosis.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[53]</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> According to M. Joly, ('Annales des Sciences Naturelles,' 2d series,
tom. xix, p. 59) in the larva of the macrourous Caridina, the natatory legs
appear before the gnathites or parts of the mouth; so that in ordinary Crustaceans
there is no invariable order of development from the anterior towards
the posterior end of the body, as has sometimes been supposed.</p></div>

<p>The mouth is more or less probosciformed (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>,
figs. <a href="#p29f08">8</a>-<a href="#p29f10">10</a>, <i>d</i>), differing considerably in this respect in different
species of the Lepadidæ; and this, probably, is due
to the larva being born in a more or less mature condition.
Its exact position likewise varies, for it arises either between
the first or second pairs of natatory legs. It is known, from<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" href="#Page_107"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span></a>
Mr. Bate's observations, to have the power of movement.
It is directed posteriorly, the œsophagus extending anteriorly;
both these directions being the same as in the
mature cirripede. Certainly during these early stages there
are no jaws or gnathites; but the margin, answering to the
labrum, is furnished with some short, thick, sharp spines,
and with hairs. In <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i> the orifice of the
œsophagus seems to lie rather beneath the upper prominent
spinose edge, which, as just remarked, probably answers
to the labrum; but this is one of the species in which the
probosciformed mouth, at least before the first moult, is not
much developed.</p>

<p>We come, now, to the three pairs of natatory legs: the
first (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, figs. <a href="#p29f08">8</a>-<a href="#p29f10">10</a>, <i>e</i>) has throughout the order only
one ramus, whereas the two succeeding pairs (<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>) are
biramous. I must here remark that the straight and strong,
and the curved plumose spines, with which these limbs,
after the first moult, become furnished, now appear to me
as more probably prehensile, rather than masticatory as I
imagined in my former volume. That these spines are
important organs to the larvæ I do not doubt. With
regard to the homologies of these three pairs of limbs, my
first impression was that they were the mandibles and
the two pairs of maxillæ in their earliest condition; but I
consider this view as quite untenable, for several reasons;
viz., the wide interval between their bases and the mouth
itself,—the somewhat variable position of the mouth with
respect to the legs,—and the position which the latter
occupy in the <i>second</i> larval stage.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[54]</span></a> A far more tenable
view is that these three pairs of legs are the three pairs of
maxillipeds, in their earliest condition, in accordance with
the view of M. Joly<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[55]</span></a> on the nature of the three very similar
pairs of natatory legs in the larva of Caridina, a macrourous
Crustacean. But, in Cirripedes, the three pairs of natatory<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" href="#Page_108"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span></a>
legs, in the larva in the first stage, are apparently the very
same as the first three pairs, in the larva in the second
stage, and in the pupa. And in the pupa the first three
pairs, which certainly correspond with the first three pairs
of cirri in the mature animal, seem to me, for reasons presently
to be assigned, to be the second, third, and fourth
thoracic limbs. Hence I am led to the conclusion that
the first pair of legs in the larva in the first stage, are
homologically the second thoracic (answering to the third
pair of maxillipeds in the higher Crustaceans), and that the
two succeeding pairs are the third and fourth thoracic limbs;
to be succeeded, in the <i>pupal</i> stage, by the fifth, sixth, and
seventh thoracic appendages.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Mr. Dana, moreover, has remarked, ('Crustacea: United States Exploring
Expedition,' p. 1386), "that he knows of no instance of a mandible becoming so
completely a leg, as to lose wholly the mandibular function even of its basal
portion."</p></div>

M. Joly's observations were made on the Caridina. I owe to the great kindness
of Mr. C. Spence Bate, an examination of some larvæ of the allied genus
<i>Hippolyte varians</i>, and I found, on dissection, the view of M. Joly, that the
three pairs of natatory legs are the maxillipeds, so far strongly confirmed, that
they followed closely, with equal intervals, the mandibles and two pairs of
maxillæ. The first pair of natatory legs in Caradina, in its earliest condition
within the egg, is uniramous, like the first pair in the larvæ of Cirripedes.
There is one fact which seems rather strongly opposed to the view of these
three pairs of legs in the larvæ of the macrourous Crustaceans being the
maxillipeds, which is that Capt. Du Cane ('Annals of Nat. Hist.,' 1838, vol. ii,
pl. 6, and 7) observed only three pairs of limbs in process of formation posteriorly
to the first three pairs, whereas there should be found, in accordance with
M. Joly's view, five pairs, <i>i. e.</i> all five pairs of ambulatory legs. This one fact
countenances the view, which I hold on the nature of the legs in the larvæ
of Cirripedes during their early stages, namely, that they are the second, third,
and fourth thoracic limbs, to be succeeded by only three additional pairs.</p></div>

<p>Lastly, behind the natatory legs, on the ventral surface,
(Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, figs. <a href="#p29f08">8</a>, <a href="#p29f09">9</a>, <i>i</i>), the body is much produced, and terminates
in a horny fork, which, after the first moult (fig. <a href="#p29f10">10</a>, <i>i</i>),
becomes much elongated. Anteriorly to this fork, on the
ventral surface, there is another fork (<i>l</i>), and again above
this I could distinguish, in <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>, after the
first moult, another fork (<i>m</i>), or at least a pair of short thick
spines. From the structure of the forked abdomen in the
known larvæ of the Podophthalmia, I presume that this
portion of the body is the abdomen of the young Cirripede,
but it is not at all plainly articulated. After the first moult,
the posterior end of the carapace (<i>h</i>), which is always pointed,
becomes much elongated and serrated on both sides;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[56]</span></a> reminding
one of the structure of the carapace of the so-called<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" href="#Page_109"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span></a>
Zoea, or larva of certain Podophthalmia. Situated under
this posterior prolongation of the carapace, there is a swelling
(<i>n</i>, with long hairs on both sides), which apparently lies on
the dorsal surface of the spinose and forked abdomen;
here, when the larva is compressed, the cellular and oily
contents of the body burst forth; and I suspect that this
swelling is the anus, for it is known from the researches
of Rathke,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[57]</span></a> that the anus in the higher Crustaceans opens
during the earliest periods dorsally.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> I suspect that the account given by Goodsir ('Edinburgh New Phil.

<p>I have given, from Burmeister,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[58]</span></a>
a lateral view (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f01">1</a>) of the one single specimen, ever
observed of a larva in this stage, belonging, as is supposed, to
the genus Lepas. The carapace has now greatly altered its
character. The two fleshy projections, as so called by Burmeister,
by which the larva adhered to the sea-weed, were
supposed by this author to include the great prehensile antennæ
of the pupa; from my observations, already alluded
to, on the two projections (Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f17">17</a>) in the closely analogous
egg-like larva, in the second stage, of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>,
by which it also adheres, I have not the least doubt that this
is the case. The small, internal, and anterior pairs of antennæ,
are, as it would appear, now aborted. The eye, according
to Burmeister, has commenced becoming double; but the
two approximate eyes are not as yet compound. The mouth
is probosciformed (<i>m</i>), and does not differ much from its
condition in the first stage; no gnathites were observed by
Burmeister, and they could not be expected to be present,
for they are not found even in the pupa. The mouth, which
in the larva in the first stage differs in different genera, in
being more or less advanced forward, here stands some way
anteriorly to the natatory legs, as in the pupal condition.
The first pair of legs is uniramous, and the two other pairs
biramous; this fact, together with the number of the legs
in this second stage being still three, and their structure being
not very different, leaves little doubt on my mind that we
here have the same three pairs as during the first stage.
The abdomen has become much shortened, but still space
is left for the development, in the pupa, of the three pos<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" href="#Page_110"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span></a>terior
pairs of legs. I may here remark that in the pupa the
anterior natatory legs have become, like the others, biramous;
but yet, as it were for the purpose of showing their metamorphosis
from the uniramous legs of the earlier stages,
they have their bristles arranged rather differently from
those on the succeeding five pairs of legs.</p>

<p>I have given a lateral
view of the pupa of <i>Lepas australis</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>), illustrative
of the description in my former volume: the specimen
is drawn as if transparent, and it was to a certain
extent thus rendered by boiling in caustic potash. A
sketch of the position of the young Cirripede within the
pupa, was made by the camera. At first the drawing will
perhaps hardly be comprehended: the darker shaded portion
to the left of the letter (<i>b</i>) shows the extent of the
sack, with the included thorax and natatory legs of the
pupa: to the right of the same letter, if we do not consider
the young included Cirripede, the only organs distinguishable
in the mass of cellular and oily matter, are the
alimentary canal, the cement-glands (<i>t</i>), <i>i. e.</i> the incipient
ovaria, and the cement-ducts (<i>t′</i>) which enter the antennæ.
A view is also given (fig. <a href="#p30f04">4</a>) of the ventral surface of the
pupa; and a transverse section (fig. <a href="#p30f07">7</a>) of the carapace, taken
close to the eye-apodemes. On comparison with the larva
in the second stage, the changes in external appearance and
structure are not very great; the prehensile antennæ are
freed from their cases; the two eyes stand further apart;
the three posterior pairs of legs have been developed, and
a small abdomen has become distinctly separated from the
thorax. Before proceeding to make a few additional remarks
and corrections to my former description of the pupa, it
will be advisable, on account of the importance of the subject,
to discuss the homologies of the limbs.</p>

<p>From the presence of eyes and of two pairs of antennæ
in the larva, during its earlier stages, the front of the
head consists, in accordance with all analogy, of three segments;
the mouth, likewise, from being formed of three
gnathites (which can be detected by dissection in the pupal
state), consists, also in accordance with all analogy, of
three segments, making altogether six segments—on the<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" href="#Page_111"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span></a>
nature of which I apprehend no objection will be raised.
In two out of the three orders into which Cirripedes may
be divided, the mouth is succeeded, in the adult animal, by
eleven most distinct segments; of which the first (<i>i. e.</i> the
seventh cephalic) differs from the succeeding seven thoracic
segments; and these seven again differ from the three abdominal
and terminal segments. Hence it must be admitted
that, as far as the cephalo-thorax of the archetype
Cirripede is concerned, it consists, like that of the archetype
Crustacean, of fourteen segments, of which eight succeed the
first-named six that form the mouth and front of the head;
and that, with the three abdominal segments, there are altogether
seventeen segments. In the order <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>, however,
which includes all common Cirripedes, both in the pupa and
in the mature animal, only six thoracic segments with their
appendages, succeed the mouth, two having been lost; and
the question arises which are these two, whether the seventh
and eighth, or the thirteenth and fourteenth (<i>i. e.</i> the two terminal
thoracic) segments; for there is no reason to suspect any
other segments of having disappeared. In my former volume,
I inferred, without sufficiently entering into my reasons, that
it was the seventh and eighth, <i>i. e.</i> the last cephalic and first
thoracic segments, which had disappeared; but I now find
that Mr. Dana<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[59]</span></a> believes that, in ordinary Crustaceans, the
abortion of the segments with their appendages almost
always takes place at the posterior end of the cephalo-thorax.
Nevertheless, after due deliberation and fresh examination
of the pupa, I must retain my former opinion,
that it is the last cephalic and first thoracic segments which
have either coalesced with the others, or wholly disappeared.
In the pupa, the mouth, although functionless, has its place
most plainly marked by being slightly prominent, and by
the presence of a sort of labrum and of a shrivelled œsophagus,
round which latter the gnathites and the new œsophagus
of the future young cirripede are in process of
formation. Now between the mouth of the pupa and the
first pair of natatory legs, there is a space of membrane,
equalling, when stretched out, the three succeeding thoracic
segments in length and breadth: this interspace, I conceive,<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" href="#Page_112"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span></a>
must have some homological signification; here then we
have at least an appearance of the abortion of appendages;
whereas, at the posterior end of the cephalo-thorax, no such
appearance is presented. Moreover this interspace of membrane
is divided nearly in the middle by a most conspicuous
fold, which, on the view here adopted, would mark the separation
of the seventh (cephalic) from the eighth (thoracic)
segment; and the interspace and fold are thus simply explained.
Lastly, I have shown, in the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a> (p. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>),
that the first and five succeeding pairs of cirri of the mature
Cirripede present certain small, but significant, resemblances
in structure and in the origin of their nerves, with the outer
pair of maxillipeds and with the five pairs of ambulatory
legs in the Podophthalmia; which resemblances are all
futile, if the cirri belong to the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th,
and 12th segments of the cephalo-thorax, or those immediately
succeeding the mouth; but are full of meaning, if
the six pairs of cirri belong, as I believe, to the 9th, 10th,
11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th segments, or the six posterior
segments of the cephalo-thorax.</p>

<p>Before commencing on details, I may premise that I have
examined the pupa of <i>Lepas australis</i>, <i>pectinata</i>, <i>fascicularis</i>,
and <i>anatifera</i>, of <i>Conchoderma virgata</i>, partially of
<i>Dichelaspis Warwickii</i>, of <i>Ibla quadrivalvis</i>, and of <a href="#Alcippe_lampas"><i>Alcippe
lampas</i></a>; and in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a> and
<a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>Hameri</i></a>. In the pupæ of all these genera there is a most
close general agreement in structure, excepting in minute
details: I was surprised to find exactly the same slight differences
in the spines on the first pair of natatory legs, as
compared with the succeeding pairs, in <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>Balanus Hameri</i></a>,
as in Lepas. The abdomen and caudal appendages of the
pupa in the abnormal <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, as we shall presently see,
offer the only marked exception to this uniformity of character
throughout the <a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>. The outline of the carapace
or shell is usually not so blunt at the anterior end, as in
the pupa of <i>Lepas australis</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>); more commonly
the shape is that of the pupa of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_707">23</a>, fig. <a href="#p23f16">16</a>).
In <i>Lepas pectinata</i> the two posterior points of the carapace
are produced into two short spines. The surface of the
carapace in <i>L. australis</i> is lined, as represented in fig. <a href="#p30f04">4</a>:<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" href="#Page_113"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span></a>
the colour of this species when alive was blue:<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[60]</span></a> in <i>L. fascicularis</i>
the surface is punctured: in <i>L. pectinata</i> it is
marked with curious points of various shapes, often star-shaped,
in parts reticulated, and confluent along the dorsal
margin, and in parts lined: in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> it is very
obscurely punctured, and in <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a> the punctures pass
into lines. The whole of what is externally visible consists
of the carapace, for this is produced not only backwards, so
as to enclose the thorax and abdomen with their appendages,
but also forwards, so as to overhang the whole front of the
animal; and the prehensile antennæ, in Lepas, Ibla, <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>,
and probably in all the genera, can be retracted within
its lower edge. The protection afforded by the carapace to
the antennæ is aided by two crests (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f07">7</a>, <i>c</i>) parallel
to this lower edge. The whole sternal surface is very narrow
(fig. <a href="#p30f04">4</a>), and is likewise protected by the carapace; that is,
when the two sides are drawn together by the adductor
muscle. The shell, however, when thus drawn together,
gapes a little at the two ends, at least in the case of <i>Lepas
australis</i>. The adductor muscle, if introduced in fig. <a href="#p30f04">4</a>,
would have crossed close anteriorly to the basal margin of
the mouth; and in fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>, its end on the near side would
have been attached under the dark cæca, which enter the
upper end of the stomach. The adductor is shaped almost
like an hour-glass, and so differs from this muscle in the
mature Lepas, in which it is of the same thickness throughout.
I may here add that the pupa of <i>Lepas australis</i> could
swim very rapidly, and often on one side in a circle; it could
walk by the aid of its antennæ, but often fell over; being
thus locomotive, and, as we shall immediately see, well provided
with senses, it cannot be considered as very lowly
organised.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> I took this species alive in the Southern Atlantic Ocean; and, mistaking it
for an independent Crustacean, was much perplexed where to class it. I had
overlooked these specimens when publishing my former volume.</p></div>

<p><i>Acoustic Organs.</i>—Commencing at the anterior end, two
small elongated orifices, 10/6000th of an inch in diameter,
(<i>e</i>, fig. <a href="#p30f04">4</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>), may be seen; these lead, as described in
my former volume, into a sack, with a bag suspended in it,
which is provided with a large nerve, and which I believe<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" href="#Page_114"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span></a>
to be the acoustic vesicle. These orifices occur in the
carapace, either in the same position, or a little more posteriorly,
in the pupæ of all Cirripedes. In <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>
they are minute, being only 2/6000th in diameter, but are
surrounded with a border: in <i>Conchoderma virgata</i> they
are also surrounded by a border: in <i>Lepas pectinata</i>,
the orifices are 3/6000th of an inch in diameter, and are very
singular from being seated on rounded prominences,
causing the carapace to have two short, blunt horns in
front. In <i>Lepas australis</i>, and I believe in the other
species, the corium round the acoustic orifices is darkly
coloured; and these coloured marks can be distinguished for
some little time on the peduncle of the young Cirripede,
after the metamorphosis, and after the entire organ, together
with the whole pupal carapace and eyes, has been moulted.
Knowing the connection in the higher Crustacea, of the
acoustic organs and the antennæ, and seeing the very
backward position (figs. <a href="#p30f02">2</a> and <a href="#p30f04">4</a>) of the one great pair of
antennæ, I have always imagined that these orifices probably
marked the normal position of the anterior pair of antennæ,
which, since the earlier larval stages, have disappeared.
And I now find<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[61]</span></a> that Schödler affirms, that in most, if not
in all Daphnidæ, there is a black spot in front of the eye,
which is connected with an opening in the basal portion
of the anterior antennæ, and he concludes that it is an organ
of hearing.</p>

<p><i>Antennæ.</i>—These, from their present position, and from
standing, in their earlier stages whilst within their envelopes
or horns, exteriorly to the small medial pair (since
aborted), I believe to be the second pair; and this is
Mr. Dana's opinion. In my former description of these
very singular and important organs (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, figs. <a href="#p30f04">4</a> and <a href="#p30f08">8</a>),
I have fallen into some considerable mistakes: the two
plates or segments (fig. <a href="#p30f04">4</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>), of which the posterior
margins are inflected as apodemes (<i>n</i>), carrying the eyes,
are certainly, as may be clearly seen in the pupa of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>,
Pl. <a href="#Page_707">23</a>, fig. <a href="#p23f16">16</a>, and as affirmed by Burmeister,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[62]</span></a> the basal<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" href="#Page_115"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span></a>
segments of the antennæ. The second or main segment
(formerly called by me the basal segment) has in some
species an upper portion of the membrane of which it
is composed, next to the body, excessively thin, and
separated from the rest of the membrane composing the
segment, by an oblique line (fig. <a href="#p23f08">8</a>, <i>o</i>), which I mistook for
its articulation with the body.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[63]</span></a> We then come to the
disc or third segment; and lastly to the fourth, or ultimate
segment. This ultimate segment, generally, has its external
corner projecting up, as a step; and this sometimes, as in
<i>Dichelaspis Warwickii</i>, gives the appearance of its consisting
of two segments; but a careful examination of this
part in Ibla, in which the step-like structure is carried to
an extreme, makes me believe that there is only one
segment.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[64]</span></a> The prehensile antennæ, therefore, like the
natatory legs, are formed of four consecutive segments, of
which the basal segments give rise to the singular apodemes,
presently to be noticed (fig. <a href="#p23f07">7</a>), that carry the great compound
eyes. This basal segment, in all Cirripedes, is
moulted with the eyes, the three other segments invariably
remaining cemented to the surface of attachment.</p>

second segment. In the fourth column, headed "Length from end of the disc

to the oblique curved line separating the thin and scarcely visible membrane
from the thicker membrane of that segment. These corrections do not in the

from the Antarctic Ocean, I observe that he divides my ultimate segment
into two segments.</p></div>

<p>In the Southern Atlantic I took some specimens of the
pupa of <i>Lepas australis</i>, not yet attached, and therefore
with the muscles of the antennæ, not having suffered any of
that absorption, which they undergo, as soon as the pupa is
permanently cemented to some floating object. In my
former volume I noticed a pair of strong muscles, attached
to the tips of the middle forks (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f07">7</a>) of the apodemes,
and I now find two pairs attached to the bases of the two
outer forks, and directed dorso-anteriorly; and two other<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" href="#Page_116"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span></a>
pairs, also attached to their bases, but directed dorso-posteriorly,
so that altogether there are five pairs of muscles
attached to the apodemes; their chief function, I should
think, was to draw the antennæ posteriorly and upwards
within the carapace; but as the apodemes cannot be moved
without the great compound eyes being likewise moved,
the muscles probably serve a double purpose. When the
pupæ were alive, I noticed that their eyes were constantly
kept in a state of vibratory movement. Flexor and extensor
muscles are attached at one end to the posterior
margin of the basal segment, and at the other end to the
second or main segment; other powerful muscles attached
to this latter segment, are prolonged by ligaments into the
disc. In <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> I observed that the disc-segment
had a movement almost like that of the wrist. Whether
any muscles enter the small terminal segment, I know not.</p>

<p>The drawing in Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f08">8</a>, of part of the second segment,
of the third or disc segment, and of the fourth or ultimate
segment, in <i>Lepas australis</i>, is, I think, very accurate. The
second segment articulates on the upper or dorsal surface
of the disc, and has the articulation on one side constricted
and formed of thin and flexible membrane; the little terminal
segment, which is turned outwards at right angles,
also, articulates on the disc. That the disc forms a true
segment is shown clearly in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f18">18</a>),
where the articulation with the second segment is not in
such close contact. The disc is either circular, as in Lepas,
or hoof-shaped, as in Ibla: in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> the disc is
rather hollowed out on the inner side. It has the power
of adhering even to so smooth a substance as glass, placed
vertically. It is surrounded by a rim of transparent membrane.
On the hinder margin some spines arise from the
central and more opaque part: in <i>Lepas australis</i>, there are
no less than seven of these spines (fig. <a href="#p30f08">8</a>): in <i>Conchoderma
virgata</i> there are only four, in <i>Scalpellum</i> and <i>Ibla</i> only
one. When the disc is placed on the surface of attachment,
these spines lie parallel to it. The middle part of the disc
is, almost always, nearly opaque; and in tracing the cement-ducts
from within the body of the pupa, or of the young
Cirripede, I in many cases traced them as far as this<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" href="#Page_117"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span></a>
point, but here lost them. From this same obscure central
part of the disc, in most, if not in all species of the
Lepadidæ, spokes radiate, which sometimes are branched,
and are not regular, not always even resembling each other
on the opposite sides of the same individual. Round the
proper membranous border of the disc, a second one may be
observed (fig. <a href="#p30f08">8</a>, <i>p</i>), which differs in shape and extent in
different specimens: under favorable circumstances, and
very high powers, it may be seen to have a reticulated
structure, and to be of a very pale brown colour; towards
the exterior margin, the reticulations become finer, and are
blended together and lost; on the inner margin, the substance
forming this membrane may be seen to come out of
the spokes. This substance is the cement, which has the
power of adhering to whatever substance it grows against;
and thus the disc of each antenna becomes cemented down,
and soon both the antennæ are surrounded by a common
border of cement, which gradually increases, after the metamorphosis,
in extent. Occasionally the cement forms little
projections, like short spines, on the edges opposite to the
orifices of the spokes.</p>

<p>The small terminal segment usually bears on its truncated
extremity six spines, some of which are occasionally hooked;
in Scalpellum, two spines, rather longer than the others, are
borne on a step some way down on the inner side of this segment;
but in Lepas, two spines (fig. <a href="#p30f08">8</a>), very much longer
than the others, arise from the outer corner of the extremity.
These two are very different from the other four borne by
this segment, or indeed any other spines on the body; for
they are quite flexible, and are furnished with a double row
of very long, straight, excessively fine hairs, which seem to be
articulated on them—the whole presenting a very beautiful
appearance. These spines are of considerable length, and in
<i>Conchoderma virgata</i> they even equal in length the whole
antenna. I can hardly doubt that these beautiful, plumose,
flexible spines, into the thick bases of which the coloured
corium could sometimes be seen to enter, serve as feelers.
Owing to the facts immediately to be mentioned, I erroneously
stated, in my former volume, that there were three
long spines.</p>

<p><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" href="#Page_118"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span></a></p>

<p>In three species of Lepas, in <i>Dichelaspis Warwickii</i>, and
in <i>Scalpellum Peronii</i>, after having torn the lately-cemented
antennæ from the surface of attachment, I observed proceeding
from the end of the terminal segment, from between
the above two groups of spines, what appeared to be
a long narrow ribbon with its end torn off; and which,
in the case of <i>Lepas australis</i>, I fancied was one of the
plumose, long, flexible spines ripped open. But now that
I have examined some of the pupæ of this species before
their attachment, I find (as represented in Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f08">8</a>, <i>v′</i>)
a flattened tube, ending in a blunt point, and having a
peculiar ringed structure. I have noticed similar appendages
to the antennæ of specimens just attached of <i>Lepas anatifera</i>.
In the Dichelaspis and the Scalpellum, the tube was very
long, and seemed, from its torn appearance, to have been
firmly attached to the supporting surface. In both these
cases, the tube came out from within another slightly
larger tube, which had been broken off close to the extremity
of the terminal segment of the antenna. In the
case of the <i>Lepas anatifera</i>, the tube expanded a little after
leaving the antenna. In the Dichelaspis, it had exactly the
same diameter as the cement-duct, which could be clearly
distinguished within the two lower segments. From these
several facts, and from the peculiar appearance of the tube
itself, I believe it to be a tube of cement-tissue which thus,
sometimes even before the pupa is attached, independently
grows outwards. That the cement-tissue can grow outwards
and assume definite forms, we know from the singular
case of <i>Lepas fascicularis</i>, in which the cement proceeding
from several apertures, forms a vesicular float round the peduncle
of not only a single individual, but often of a group
of specimens: we shall presently find a somewhat analogous
fact in the case of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. It is possible that this tube,
proceeding from the extremity of the antenna, may be the
channel through which cement continues to be poured forth
during the continued growth of the above Cirripedes; and
the manner in which this is effected, considering how firmly
the end of the peduncle is cemented down, has always
appeared to me a difficulty. In those pupæ of <i>Lepas
australis</i>, which I caught swimming about unattached, it is<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" href="#Page_119"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span></a>
surprising that the disc should have been edged with cement,
and that a tube, similarly formed, should have grown out
of the ultimate segment: it shows, I presume, that the
cement-tissue will grow out, whether or no the pupa has
succeeded in finding a proper object for attachment. Lastly,
I have felt some surprise, in two or three instances in observing
some dark purple pigment-cells, like those in the
corium, within the terminal tube of cement; and likewise
within the spokes of cement in the disc: this is the only fact
which causes me the least doubt, whether I have rightly determined
the nature of the terminal tube, as wholly formed of
cement tissue; or whether it may not be covered by an outer
integument, itself lined by true corium, coloured purple.</p>

<p>Finally, I may add, that, excepting in small details, the
prehensile antennæ present no difference throughout the
Order: I have minutely examined them in several genera of
the Lepadidæ; and in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, I have seen them in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>,
and in several species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. In <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>
I have examined them carefully; they are smaller and thicker
than in Lepas, with the second or main segment bowed
outwards, carrying its usual single spine; with the disc
excised on its inner margin and apparently without the
spoke-like vessels for the cement; and with the ultimate
segment proportionably longer, and carrying, I believe, six
spines, of which two appeared to be longer and more
flexible than the other four shorter and somewhat hooked
spines. In <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>Coronula balænaris</i></a>, also, the terminal segment
is, proportionably to the others, of large size. Not only
throughout the order, but throughout the whole Class, the
antennæ are singularly uniform in structure, as will be seen,
when the last two orders are described.</p>


<p><i>Eyes.</i>—These present no difference, except in size,
throughout the class; and have been sufficiently described
in my former volume. The true basal segments of the antennæ
(incorrectly designated formerly as sternal plates or
segments) are separated from each other by a deep fold;
and are separated from the edges of the carapace on each
side by a crest and slight fold (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f07">7</a>, <i>c</i>; and <a href="#p30f04">4</a>);
these folds and crests die out posteriorly, and disappear.
The hinder, rounded margins of the basal segments are<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" href="#Page_120"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span></a>
inflected inwards, and their corners are produced far up into
the body, thus forming the curious UU-like apodemes.
These apodemes exist throughout the whole class; and the
outer arms always carry the great compound eyes. I
noticed, in <i>Lepas pectinata</i>, that the two middle arms are
proportionably longer than in <i>L. australis</i>. Owing to the
presence of these apodemes, and to certain coloured marks
on the adjoining corium, the eyes, though <span class="correction" title="In the original book: inclosed">enclosed</span> fairly
within the carapace, yet deceptively appear pedunculated,
so that even J. Vaughan Thompson was thus deceived.
I have already described the several muscles attached to these
apodemes, and the constant vibratory movement of the eyes.
Whilst the pupa remains a freely swimming animal, the
eyes are included, not only within the shell or carapace, but
(as would naturally happen) within the corium or true skin
lining the carapace; but after the pupa has become attached,
preparatory to its final metamorphosis (in the state represented
at Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>.), not only are the muscles, as before
remarked, which are attached to the apodemes, absorbed,
but so is the corium investing the apodemes and the immediately
adjoining parts of the carapace. Hence it comes
that the new corium of the young Cirripede within, is formed
in a deep transverse fold across the whole lower half of the
animal, and the apodemes with the eyes are thus, as it were,
rejected from within the corium, though still remaining
within the carapace. Consequently in this final stage, the
eyes and apodemes are very conspicuous from the outside,
being seen only through the transparent carapace. I presume
that the eyes at this period have become functionless,
with the optic nerve divided and absorbed. The eyes,
apodemes, and carapace soon afterwards are all moulted
together.</p>

<p>The eyes of Cirripedes certainly undergo a remarkable
series of changes: in the larvæ in the first stage, there is a
single eye, perhaps formed by the confluence of two eyes,
occupying the normal position in the front of the head: in the
second stage, according to Burmeister, the eye has become
double, but the two are as yet simple; they are now situated
posteriorly to the second pair of antennæ: in the third or
pupal stage, they remain in the same situation, but have<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" href="#Page_121"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span></a>
become compound, of great size, and are attached to the
apodemes of the antennæ: in the mature and fourth stage,
they have moved someway posteriorly, and again have become
simple, of minute size, and are either confluent, as in
the Lepadidæ, or tolerably far apart, as in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>. It
must not be supposed that the eye of the mature Cirripede
is metamorphosed from the eye of the pupa, for such is not
the case; the new eyes and old eyes being formed someway
apart, and frequently both can be seen within the pupa (as
in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_707">23</a>, fig. <a href="#p23f16">16</a>) at the same time. It is scarcely
possible that the eye of the larva in the first stage, can be
changed into the double eyes of the second stage; though
these latter may <span class="correction" title="In the original book: possible">possibly</span> be multiplied into the eyes of the
pupa, as both continue to occupy nearly the same position.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[65]</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> Zenker, in his 'Physiological Remarks on the Daphnidæ,' ('Journal of the
Microscopical Society,' 1853, p. 274), speaks of a "tripartite azygous eye"
as common amongst Crustacea, and as occurring "in conjunction with the
aggregated eyes in Artemia, Argulus, &amp;c.; but as appearing regularly in all the
Branchiopoda and Siphonostomata as the <em>earliest</em> visual organ." Hence I conclude
that this azygous eye is the homologue of that single eye which appears
in the earliest larval stage of Cirripedes; and that the compound eyes of the
cirripedial pupa, answer to the aggregated eyes of Artemia and Argulus, &amp;c.,
with the difference, that in these latter genera the single eye is retained. See,
also, Von Siebold, 'Anatomie Comparée,' tom. i, p. 435.</p></div>


<p><i>Mouth</i>, <i>thorax</i>, <i>limbs</i>, <i>abdomen</i>.—I have nothing to add
regarding the mouth, except to confirm my former account;
viz., that it is functionless, consisting merely of crests,
which project inwardly between the gnathites of the young
Cirripede, and of a shrivelled closed tube representing the
œsophagus. In fact the mouth is a model of the outside
of the mouth of the young Cirripede. I may remark that
some little way beneath the membrane answering to the
labrum, a pair of ligamentous apodemes, the use of which I
do not know, slightly penetrate the body. The degree of
prominence of the mouth varies, but it is far less than in the
mature animal. On the limbs I have nothing particular to
add: the drawing of the first pair of legs (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f05">5</a>) is,
I think, very accurate: I observed all the spines here figured,
on the corresponding leg of the pupa of <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>Balanus Hameri</i></a>.
The five posterior pairs of legs differ only in the outer
ramus having five plumose spines, instead of four, and one
short simple spine at the exterior angle, making six alto<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" href="#Page_122"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span></a>gether.
The legs, in their natural position (fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>), have
only the terminal segments of their two rami directed
posteriorly; and as a consequence the spine (close to <i>i</i> in
fig. <a href="#p30f05">5</a>), borne on the penultimate segment of the outer
ramus, is directed in the same line with that segment and
with the pedicel, namely, anteriorly, and at right angles to
the natatory plumose spines. This short spine acts, I
imagine, as a defensive weapon; it has been omitted in
fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>. Of the thorax I need not give, from my notes, any
more details. The abdomen (fig. <a href="#p30f06">6</a>) is similarly constructed,
as far as I have seen, throughout the order, with the exception
of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_707">23</a>, fig. <a href="#p23f17">17</a>), in which it is composed of
only one segment instead of three. In this genus the caudal
appendages likewise consist of only one segment, with
very short spines. In the pupa of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, the
three spines borne on each caudal appendage are very much
more unequal in size than in the pupa of <i>Lepas australis</i>,
although in the latter (fig. <a href="#p23f06">6</a>) the inner spine is considerably
thicker than the two outer. Whether the three segments
of which the abdomen is composed, are the three anterior
or three posterior, of the normal seven segments, I know
not: on the view that they are the three posterior segments,
I presume, according to analogy, that the caudal appendages
are borne on the penultimate segment, and that the ultimate
segment is here quite aborted.</p>

<p>On the <i>internal viscera</i> I have nothing to add. The
cement-duct is represented in Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>, <i>t′</i>, on the near
side, running into the antennæ; and I repeatedly traced it, for
the duct is very strong, as far as the disc segment; at the
other end it joins the cement-gland (<i>t</i>) on the same side of
the body. This cement-gland is proved, by the clearest series
of facts, to be converted into the incipient ovaria and ovarian
cæca. The cement-glands in the older pupæ could be traced
as far as the cæca of the stomach, exactly where the ovaria
lie in the mature animal; but in some young pupæ, they
extended further posteriorly, past the mouth, between the
outer and inner membranes of the overlapping carapace.
I have faintly shown the course of the stomach, with its two
cæca at the upper end; the anus lies between the caudal
appendages, at the extremity (above <i>b′</i>) of the abdomen. At<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" href="#Page_123"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span></a>
this age there is no trace of the vesiculæ seminales, so
conspicuous in the mature Cirripede.</p>


<p><i>Young Cirripede, whilst within the pupa.</i>—I repeatedly
succeeded in dissecting the young <i>Lepas australis</i> out
of the pupa; and by the previous action of boiling potash,
and by a strong light, I was enabled to make a camera
sketch (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>) of the relative positions of their
several parts. The young Cirripede is drawn very faintly,
and is best seen by holding the plate in the same position
with the mature animal, of which a section is given in
my volume on the Lepadidæ, Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f04">4</a>. I may just
notice how complicated are the membranes in a longitudinal
section taken at this period: we have, 1st, beginning at
the back, the horny tissue of the carapace or bivalve shell
of the pupa; 2d, the primordial valve (<i>z</i>, in fig. <a href="#p30f03">3</a>) of the
young Cirripede; 3d and 4th, two folds of corium; 5th,
the membrane of the sack of the Cirripede; 6th, the membrane
of the sack of the pupa; 7th, the outer tunic of the
thorax of the pupa; 8th, the outer tunic of the thorax of
the young Cirripede; 9th, the corium lining the latter
membrane; and these nine membranes would be repeated
on the opposite side of the section, if it were taken through
either side of the shell or carapace, bordering the orifice.</p>

<p>After the exuviation of the outer membranes of the pupa,
certain pre-existing coloured marks in the corium, such as
those round the eyes and round the acoustic orifices, along
the ridge of the back and on the borders of the orifice, &amp;c.,
are still retained by the young Cirripede, either temporarily
or permanently; so that the correspondence of part with part
of the external surface admits of no doubt. Moreover, the
three terminal segments of the antennæ are invariably retained
by the young Cirripede, though in a functionless
condition, and into them the outer membrane of the body,
and an important organ, viz., the cement-ducts are still
prolonged; hence these prolongations must be considered as
aborted antennæ. Again, we have seen that the mouth of
the young Cirripede is formed under the rudimentary mouth
of the pupa, with the new œsophagus, round the old œsophagus,
leading into the same alimentary canal. The twenty-four
extreme tips, likewise, of the six pairs of biramous<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" href="#Page_124"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span></a>
cirri of the Cirripede are formed within the twenty-four extremities
of the six pairs of biramous, natatory legs of the
pupa. Consequently, in the Cirripede and pupa, thus far,
part corresponds with part, notwithstanding that new eyes
are formed posteriorly to the old eyes, and new acoustic
organs in a quite different position from the old ones; but
now we come to a most important diversity in the metamorphosis,
or rather to follow Professor Owen,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[66]</span></a> in the metagenesis,
of the young Cirripede. Although, as just stated,
the extremities of the cirri are formed within the legs of the
pupa, yet, from the great length of the cirri, they occupy more
than the whole of the thorax of the pupa; so that the thorax
of the young Cirripede is not formed within the pre-existing
thorax of the pupa, but within that part of the pupa, (homologically
a portion of the first three cephalic segments), which
lies anteriorly to the thorax. As a consequence of this, the
pedicels and lower portions of the cirri, the segments of the
thorax and its dorsal surface, all come to occupy a position
at nearly right angles to that of the corresponding parts in
the pupa: this is shown in Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>. And as a further
consequence, (and this is the more important point), the
sack, which both in the young Cirripede and pupa is
formed by the overhanging and produced portion of the
carapace, and which is <em>internally lined by a reduplication of
the membrane of the thorax</em>, is necessarily, owing to the
changed position of the thorax, altered in extent and carried
much further; namely, from extending merely parallel to
the longitudinal axis of the pupa (from <i>b</i> to <i>b′</i>), it is now in
the young Cirripede, in addition, carried (to <i>s′</i>) almost quite
across the inside of the animal. Hence it comes that the
young Cirripede is, as I have said in my former volume,
internally almost intersected; and its body remains attached
only by a small space, (see the broken line, round <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
in Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, of a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> with the shell, &amp;c., removed
from one side), to the sternal or ventral, inner surface of the
carapace,—the carapace being modified either into the capitulum
and peduncle, or into the shell with its operculum
and basis. As a still further consequence of this change of<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" href="#Page_125"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span></a>
position of the body of the young Cirripede within the body
of the pupa, the alimentary canal becomes shortened to fully
half its former length. At the same time, the interspace
between the mouth and first pair of legs of the pupa, (consisting
of the seventh and eighth segments of the archetype),
is quite lost in the Cirripede by coalescence. The final cause
of the thorax of the young Cirripede not being developed
within the thorax of the pupa, probably is, that the cirri
may be formed of considerable length, so as to be immediately
enabled to seize prey; and that the thorax, which
supports the cirri (and this probably is even more important)
should be as free as possible within the sack, so as to aid
the captorial action of the cirri.</p>

<p>After these remarks, more especially with regard to the
formation of the sack, if any one will look at the sectional
drawing of a pedunculated Cirripede in my former volume,
or of a sessile Cirripede (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>) in this present volume,
in which latter the shell adds to the complexity, he will perceive
the cause of the extreme difficulty in understanding the
relative position of the parts throughout the whole class.
Even after I had discovered that the prehensile antennæ of
the pupa might always be found in the centre of the basis
or surface of attachment, and which fact, it might have been
thought, should have convinced me that this was the anterior
end of the whole animal, yet still I fancied that the
prominent mouth represented the entire head, and that
the shell was something quite distinct. It is clear that
others have been equally perplexed; for that which is the
anterior end in the eyes of one naturalist, is the posterior
end in the eyes of another; so with the dorsal and ventral
surfaces: one naturalist considers the peduncle of the Lepas
as the abdomen; another considers it as a pair of metamorphosed,
thoracic limbs, &amp;c.! The probable position of the
segments of the body of a mature Cirripede, in relation to
the three anterior cephalic segments, or carapace, is shown
in the diagram (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f06">6</a>) of the supposed position of the
mature <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> within its pupal envelopes. Here, in
the diagram, the two segments immediately succeeding the
mouth (<i>c</i>), which are the seventh and eighth of the archetype,
(for the mouth consists of three segments, and all in front<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" href="#Page_126"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span></a>
of the mouth of three other segments), have come to adhere
by their dorsal surfaces to the internal surface of the
carapace,—that is, of the first three segments, which ought
of course to have stood quite in advance of these two segments,
and these two segments again ought to have stood
in advance of the mouth. The mouth is directed posteriorly,
instead of from the body; and the three segments
of which it is formed (closed at their anterior end by the
labrum), and are very small compared to the relatively monstrously
great, three anterior cephalic segments, composing
the carapace. To place the segments of the body of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>
in proper sequence, in respect to those of the carapace,
and in accordance with the sequence of the archetype
Crustacean, it would be necessary, by seizing the extremity
of the abdomen (<i>a</i>), to tear the two segments succeeding
the mouth from their dorsal attachment, as far back as the
basal margin of the labrum; and then pull them till they
stood posteriorly to (or in the diagram, above) the mouth;
which latter part would, by the same movement, be made
to project out at right angles to the ventral surface, and
would then be preceded only by the first three, great, confluent
segments of the head, which being produced backwards,
form the carapace. All that has just been said on the
position, in <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, of the segments of the body in relation
to those forming the carapace, I believe to be applicable
to all ordinary Cirripedes, with this difference, that in the
latter, after the metamorphosis, the two segments succeeding
the mouth quite disappear on the ventral surface, and
dorsally are either aborted or have coalesced with the adjoining
segments.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Act_of_Metamorphosis" id="Act_of_Metamorphosis" /><span class="correction" title="In the original book, this title appeared in the TOC but not in the text"><i>Act of Metamorphosis.</i></span></h3>

<p>When the due time for the act of metamorphosis has
arrived, the pupal carapace splits along the dorsal ridge, and
is cast off, together with the acoustic sacks, the basal segments
of the two antennæ, and the great, black, compound
eyes, hanging to the UU-like apodemes. The three terminal
segments of the antennæ invariably remain cemented to
the surface of attachment. The exuviæ usually continue
for a time united to the cemented antennæ, but are finally
washed away. Besides the split along the dorsal ridge, the<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" href="#Page_127"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span></a>
carapace separates, all round the orifice, from the delicate
tunic lining the sack and investing the thorax and natatory
legs of the pupa; for these membranes are not moulted for
some considerable time afterwards. Hence all these inner
parts retain for a period the appearance and structure of the
natatory pupa, whilst the exterior resembles, in every respect,
a fixed and perfect Cirripede.</p>

<p>In my former volume, I have insisted on the important
and curious results which ensue from the eye-apodemes
penetrating so deeply into the body (see Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f07">7</a>, in
which the proportions are more correct than in fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>), with
the eyes attached exteriorly to their outer arms; for as these
apodemes have to be ejected, the external membrane of the
young Cirripede (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>) has to be formed in a deep
fold or arch over them, and consequently the membrane on
the sternal surface is formed considerably longer than on
the dorsal surface. From this it follows, when all the membranes
are free and are stretched fully out after the moult,
that the whole animal, posteriorly to the cemented-down
surface, turns vertically up, and assumes its normal position
at right angles to the surface of attachment, and to that
which it held in its pupal condition; for the pupa always adheres
with its sternal surface parallel to the surface of attachment.
A young Lepas, which has just moulted its pupal
carapace, and has assumed its proper vertical position, with
the cemented antennæ and the surface of attachment remaining
as before, is shown at fig. <a href="#p30f03">3</a>, but is drawn on a smaller
scale than the pupa fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>, out of which it may be supposed
to have been excluded. In this fig. <a href="#p30f03">3</a>, it may be observed
that the natatory legs and caudal appendages of the pupa
have not as yet been moulted. The fact of the stretching
out, in the young Cirripede, of the fold of membrane, which
in pupa, just before the metamorphosis passes over the
apodemes and eyes, is well shown by three darkly-coloured
bands in the corium, which in the pupa are curled, but after
the moult, are stretched straight out on the peduncle of the
young Lepas.</p>

<p>The pupa, and consequently the young Cirripede, from
being attached at first by the antennæ, does not adhere by the
actual anterior extremity, but by the sternal surface near it;<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" href="#Page_128"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span></a>
the anterior extremity, however, soon becomes cemented
down, and afterwards, in ordinary cases, ceases to grow.
In <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, however, and in certain genera of the
Lepadidæ, as <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, Lithotrya, and Anelasma, the anterior
or basal extremity does continue to grow, and is not cemented
down, and therefore comes to be prolonged beyond the original
point of attachment; in order to allow of this, the
surface to which the Cirripede is attached has to yield, apparently
simply to the pressure exerted in the case of Anelasma,
but in the three other genera, to the rasping action of the
roughened surface of the extremity of the peduncle.</p>

<p>When after a period the pupal membranes of the sack,
thorax, and natatory legs are moulted, the cirri of the
young Cirripede are curled up, and its thorax is raised
towards the orifice, and we have the animal in its ordinary
position, and perfect with the exception of a few parts to
be further developed or modified. For, instead of calcareous
valves, we have at this period only the so-called primordial
valves, composed of chitine; and in the case of <i>Lepas
australis</i>, some minute spines and some coloured marks on
the peduncle, which soon disappear. The muscles, which
enter the three terminal segments of the antennæ in the
pupa, have to be absorbed and converted into ligamentous
threads. In Lepas, the labrum has to become bullate; and
the cæca have to increase in number round the upper end
of the stomach, and their dark colour and that of the whole
alimentary canal has to disappear or be much weakened.
The filamentary appendages at the bases of the cirri, which
generally contain some of the testes, have to be developed.
The probosciformed penis, which at first equals only the
pedicels of the posterior cirri in length, and is apparently
imperforate, has to increase greatly in length. The testes
and vesiculæ seminales have to be formed. And lastly, and
this is a more important point, the two gut-formed cement-glands
(or incipient ovaria, <i>t</i>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>) which, at the
period of the moulting of the carapace and eye-apodemes,
and when the whole animal was upturned, came to occupy,
together with the cement-ducts (<i>t′</i>), their normal position,
<i>i. e.</i> nearly parallel to the sternal surface, now undergo further
changes. Their upper and posterior ends lying near<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" href="#Page_129"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span></a>
the cæca of the stomach, increase in size, but retain nearly
the same character, and thus form the two true ovaria; their
middle parts become emptied of their cellular contents, and
are converted into the two simple ovarian tubes; and their
lower ends branch out, inosculate, and form the inextricable
mass of ovarian tubes and cæca. The points of junction
on each side between the two cement-ducts and the newly
branched ovarian tubes, become now developed into the
two cement-glands. The cement-ducts, which continue
throughout life growing, either still enter the old antennæ
and there pour out the cement-tissue, or they pour it out
through special orifices formed for this purpose in the lower
part of the peduncle. The changes, supervening during
the metamorphosis, in the ovaria and in the cementing
apparatus, here described, I have no doubt are general
throughout the Order.</p>

<p>I have above alluded to the <i>primordial valves</i>; these are
beautiful objects when viewed under a high power: they
are composed of chitine without a trace of calcareous matter,
but prefigure in shape, size, and direction of growth, the
shelly valves soon to be formed under and round them.
They are composed of an outer membrane, with its margins
separated by yellow thickened rims from the membrane
uniting the several primordial valves together; and
this outer membrane is underlaid by a single layer of
generally hexagonal, thickish cells (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>), varying
from 1 to 2/6000th of an inch in diameter. These cells seem to
contain a nucleus; and they are at first separated from each
other by clear interspaces. If a specimen be taken, only
a little before the formation of the calcareous valves, one
or more layers of membrane, marked by an hexagonal reticulation,
can be separated from the lower surface of the
main hexagonal network. It is a singular fact, that in
those genera in which there are several valves, the primordial
valves occur only on five, namely, on the two scuta,
two terga, and the carina; and these are the most persistent
valves in the several genera. The other valves are
prefigured only by brownish membrane, without the hexagonal
tissue. In the mature <i>Lepas</i>, the membrane connecting
the several shelly valves is not moulted, but dis<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" href="#Page_130"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span></a>integrates;
in the primordial valves, however, which stand
far separate from each other, this membrane is moulted;
and immediately after the first moult, the first layer of shell
appears under and a little way beyond each primordial
valve; shelly matter likewise appears, at least in some cases,
between the cells of the hexagonal tissue. The young shelly
valves are connected together, at each successive moult, by
narrower strips of membrane, till, in the case of Lepas, the
valves when mature come to touch each other (Lepadidæ,
Pl. 1, fig. 5). The primordial valves are often preserved
for a long time on the umbones, or centres of growth
of the five valves, on which they occur, in the same manner
as the larva-shell is sometimes preserved on the apex of
certain spiral molluscs. Had not Cirripedes gone through
so many and such complicated metamorphoses, this last
state, when furnished only with primordial valves and with
several internal organs only partially or not at all developed,
would have deserved to have ranked as a special stage, and
not as merely subordinate to the last or pupal condition.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, or sessile Cirripedes, the young animal,
immediately after the metamorphosis, or still better if dissected
out of the pupal carapace, as I succeeded in doing
with <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, may be said to be pedunculated;
for it is attached by a little disc of cement closely surrounding
the antennæ, the rest of the membranous basis
forming an almost semi-globular, flexible peduncle. The
valves, at this the earliest period, are all membranous, and
do not overlap each other. In the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> they do not
present the peculiar structure of the primordial valves of the
Lepadidæ; but in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, in <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, I saw
traces of this structure. Calcareous valves are soon formed
under the membranous valves. The opercular valves, at
this early period, are much larger than the valves or compartments
of the shell, which are only four in number,
for the carino-lateral compartments are not yet formed.
The compartments from the first are surprisingly strong,
and have their alæ already formed and overlapped by the
adjoining compartments; but of the radii there is as yet no
trace. The four compartments form a narrow but nearly
circular hoop, which, from its relatively large diameter,<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" href="#Page_131"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span></a>
tends to draw down the upper or posterior end of the
animal, now forming the opercular valves; and as the
basis soon becomes throughout cemented to the surface
of attachment, the young Cirripede is much depressed.
Soon the opercular valves are drawn a little way down
within the shell, becoming attached to the sheath, instead
of, as at first, to the very summits of the compartments. In
regard to the changes which take place in the shell, in the
number of the segments in the cirri, and in the number of
spines borne on these segments, &amp;c., during the continued
growth of the animal, as they are chiefly important for the
identification of the species, I will here refer to a discussion
on this subject under the head of the Genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="On_the_Homologies_of_the_Carapace" id="On_the_Homologies_of_the_Carapace" /><i>On the Homologies of the Carapace and Shelly Valves.</i></h3>

<p>In
the pupa, the carapace is produced, not only posteriorly,
but anteriorly, so as to cover the entire animal, with the
exception of a narrow sternal surface (Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f04">4</a>): in
front it is notched, where the sternal surface terminates,
and from this notch a faint line runs along the dorsal surface,
separating its tergal elements. In the young Cirripede,
after the metamorphosis, there is no trace of this
medial dorsal suture, or of the wider sternal surface.
Looking at the several genera of the Lepadidæ, the external
covering of the whole peduncle and capitulum is so
continuous and of so uniform a nature, that I think we
must consider the whole as a carapace, of which the sternal
borders have become completely confluent; formerly I was
inclined to look at the capitulum alone as formed by the
carapace, and at the peduncle as being composed of the
two or three anterior cephalic segments, cased only by their
own integuments. As far as can be discerned, the carapace
in the pupa, and consequently in the Cirripede, consists
only of the tergal elements of the segments; and this
seems likewise to be the case with the carapace of the
Podophthalmia. Until lately,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[67]</span></a> Prof. Milne Edwards doubted
whether the carapace in the higher Crustaceans (to which
I believe the carapace of Cirripedes must be compared) was
formed by the backward production of the third segment,<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" href="#Page_132"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span></a>
which bears the second pair of antennæ, or of the fourth,
<i>i. e.</i> the mandibular segment; but from the distribution of the
nerves, he now argues that it must mainly belong to the
third segment. In Cirripedes, the course of the nerves leads
to the same conclusion; for the whole shell, sack, and peduncle
are supplied with nerves proceeding from the compounded
ganglion, which belongs to the second and third
cephalic segments.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[68]</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> This conclusion is supported by the structure of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>: in this
Cirripede there is not a vestige of a carapace, and as the whole of the animal in
front of the mouth is almost utterly aborted, being reduced to a mere covering
to the two cement-ducts, and as, on the other hand, the mouth with the mandibles,
though peculiarly modified, is not at all aborted, there is a strong probability,
that the abortion of the carapace is connected with the aborted state
of the three anterior cephalic segments; and that the carapace in its origin is
not any way related to the fourth or mandibular segment.</p></div>

<p>The whole of the head in front of the mouth, together
with the carapace, is, as we know, formed of three segments;
and each of these segments, homologically, ought
to consist of eight elements; I recall to mind these facts,
inasmuch as the transverse separation between the peduncle
and capitulum in the Lepadidæ, and between the basis, the
shell, and the opercular valves in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, might be
thought to be connected with the separation of the three
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: caphalic">cephalic</span> segments. So again, as in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> the shell
normally consists of eight compartments, these might be
thought to be related to the eight elements of one or other of
the three segments. But I see no reason for admitting this
view; and in the case of the carina and rostrum, two of
the most persistent and important of the compartments,
they exactly cover the sutures which ought to separate the
two tergal and two sternal elements of the segment. The
valves, moreover, often form many more whorls than three,
or the number of the true cephalic segments in front of the
mouth; and in each whorl the valves tend to stand in tile-like
or alternate order, with respect to those in the whorls
both above and below, which would not be the case, if they
were the eight elements of the segments.</p>

<p>For the true homologies of the sclerodermic plates, or
Shelly valves, with which the external covering of Cirripedes
is so generally strengthened, we must, I believe, look to
the carapace of the Podophthalmia. In these latter, we<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" href="#Page_133"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span></a>
find the carapace composed of sclerodermic plates, which,
though closely joined and only occasionally separated by
sutures, yet in their origin are distinct;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[69]</span></a> they tend, also, to
be arranged in alternate or tile-like order. As the animal
grows, the old sclerodermic plates, all joined together, are
moulted, and new ones, also all joined together, of a larger
size, are formed beneath. Now let us imagine the growth
to be more gradual but yet periodical, and the new and
larger sclerodermic plates, when formed under the old ones,
to adhere firmly to them; the older plates would thus be
prevented from becoming confluent, and instead of being all
moulted together, as is now the case, they would be almost
continually separated from each other, owing to the almost
continuous increase in size of the new underlying plates.
Consequently lines of splitting would run between the
several plates, however numerous they might be, instead of
there being, as now, a single line of splitting extending
down the back. In fact, we should have the identical
manner of growth of the shell or carapace, which occurs in
Cirripedes. It is on this ground, and from the several
points of homological resemblance incidentally mentioned
in the last few paragraphs, that, in the early part of this
<a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a> (p. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>), when discussing the whole class, I
stated that I believed that the carapace of Cirripedes presented
more real resemblance with the carapaces of the
Podophthalmia, or higher Crustacea, than with those of the
lower Crustacea, though in mere shape they more nearly

<h3 class="center"><a name="Cementing_Apparatus" id="Cementing_Apparatus" /><i>Cementing Apparatus.</i><span class="normal"> (Plate </span><a href="#Page_712"><span class="normal">28</span></a><span class="normal">.)</span></h3>

<p>I have already (p. <a href="#Page_128">128</a>) given an account of the manner in
which, in the pupa of Lepas, the cement-tissue escapes
from the prehensile antennæ, and of the structure of the
cement-ducts, and of the cement-glands or incipient
ovaria; and likewise of the changes by which these organs
assume their ultimate form in the mature Cirripede. In
my former volume, on the Lepadidæ, I described the
cement-glands and the cement-tissue in several genera,<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" href="#Page_134"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span></a>
and I have there shown (singular as the fact is) that the
two cement-glands, with their contents, actually consist of
ovarian tubes with their contents (for there seemed to be a
relation in the state of fulness in both) in a modified condition.
In the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, I am not able, from the difficulty
of the dissection, to confirm these conclusions, excepting in
so far that the tubes on which the cement-glands are
formed, run into the mass of ovarian cæca; but, I may add,
that in the abnormal <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, belonging to another
Order (see the section, Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f01">1</a>), nothing could be
plainer than that the membrane of the ovarian sack (<i>b</i>)
formed the cement-ducts, and that their cellular contents,
which within the sack (<i>a</i>) were in process of conversion into
ova, within the ducts were converted into the cement-tissue.
This cement, by some unknown power, travels down the
ducts, and debouches at the antennæ.</p>

<p>In the Lepadidæ, there are only two cement-glands,
which are situated high up in the midst of the ovarian
cæca, with one cement-duct proceeding from each: both the
glands and ducts increase in size with the age of the animal:<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[70]</span></a>
the cement issues either permanently from the prehensile
antenna, or, after a short period, through apertures in the
peduncle, arranged irregularly or in straight lines,—the last
formed apertures being furthest from the central and basal
point of the peduncle. In the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, on the other hand,
at each period of growth, a pair of new cement-glands is
developed, larger than those last formed, and making, with
the older glands, a chain, connected together by what I
have called the cement-trunk. The cement-trunk consists
of a tube, which generally becomes enlarged just before
entering each gland. The glands, the cement-trunk, and
cement-ducts, all adhere to the basal membrane or basal
shelly plate. Each gland gives rise to two cement-ducts,
these often bifurcate, and sometimes repeatedly bifurcate
and inosculate before pouring out their contents round the
circumference of the basis; and sometimes they all first enter
a circumferential cement-duct. The probable cause of the<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" href="#Page_135"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span></a>
greater complexity of the cementing apparatus and of the
greater number of the excretory orifices in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, compared
with the Lepadidæ, is that the entire surface of the
broad basis, which answers to the whole peduncle in the Lepadidæ,
is firmly cemented down to the supporting object, instead
of merely the basal end of the peduncle. The cement
issues either in a cellular condition, or more commonly as a
fine network, which, at a short distance from the orifices
(Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>, <i>z</i>), becomes so fine as to form a sheet or
layer: I may here recall the fact, that in the cement proceeding
from the disc of the antennæ, in some species of
Lepas, a similar structure was observed. The cement itself
presents the same transparent, brown, laminated, structureless
appearance, and the same chemical reaction, as described
in my former volume. The cement has the capacity
of occupying and filling up all inequalities in the supporting
surface; I have seen it, when spread over an encrusting
Flustra, present an exact model of every cell; in the case of
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, it seems, as we shall immediately see, to have the
power of penetrating into, and even almost blending with
the epidermis of the supporting Cetacean. The last-formed
cement-glands and cement-ducts present a delicate and
transparent appearance, and contain cellular matter; whereas
the old cement-glands, and sometimes the old cement-ducts,
are filled with brownish cement, not acted on by boiling
potash. The foregoing remarks are confined to the sub-family
<a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, for I have not been able to examine
thoroughly the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, and can only affirm, that in
<a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> and <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a> the cement-ducts repeatedly
bifurcate and inosculate, in the same manner as in the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>. I will now proceed to describe, in some detail,
the cementing apparatus in the several following genera.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> I had some slight reason to suspect in Pollicipes that new cement-glands
were successively formed: this is more probable in this genus than in the
others, inasmuch as it is the most nearly related to the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>.</p></div>

<p><a href="#Genus_Coronula"><i>Coronula.</i></a>—The cementing apparatus is here more simple
than in any other genus of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, and I have studied
it more carefully. The basal membrane of <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>Coronula
balænaris</i></a> is figured in Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, and must first be
described; its relation to the shell will hardly be understood
without looking at the outline of the folded walls of this
species, in Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f05">5</a>. The basal membrane closes the
central circular hollow, and is continuous with rays (not<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" href="#Page_136"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span></a>
represented in Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>) extending under the doubled walls
and terminal transverse loops. It has eighteen concave
sides, corresponding with the inner ends of the folded walls,
for each of the six compartments is trebly folded. The
membrane consists of successive, conformable slips (<i>c′</i>, <i>c′</i>),
bordered exteriorly by thickened yellowish rims, and
internally overlapping (when viewed from the inner side)
the few last-formed slips, and then thinning out. The
membrane forming each slip is itself laminated. The
middle portion, about 1/50th of an inch in diameter, is rather
opaque, owing to the slips being so close together. Beyond
this central part, the slips suddenly increase in size, but yet
have a different shape from the 18-sided outline, which
they ultimately assume: this difference is owing to the
great changes in shape, as explained under the genus
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, which the shell undergoes, when the walls at first
assume their folded structure. The walls are invested by
longitudinally striated membrane (<i>p</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>p</i>, fig. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>), which
turns in under their basal edges; and this membrane is
united with the basal membrane, by what I shall call the
circumferential slip (<i>b</i>), and which is shaded in fig. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>,
simply for the sake of catching the eye. It is the circumferential
slip of membrane which sends rays under the
spoke-like folded walls: thin as it is, this slip is yet laminated,
but is not bordered by thickened edges. The membrane
investing the walls is, like the basal membrane,
formed of successive slips with thickened edges, which overlapping
(viewed from the inside) the last-formed slips, project
beyond them, and so face the edges of the slips in the basal
membrane; they are only obscurely indicated in fig. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>.
The circumferential slip (<i>b</i>) lies over (as viewed from within)
both the basal and wall membrane. This whole structure
will, perhaps, be best understood by the sectional diagram
(fig. <a href="#p28f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), in which the letters (<i>c′</i>, <i>c′</i>) show the slips of basal
membrane; (<i>p</i>) the parietal membrane, coating the outside
surface of the walls of the shell, not here represented;
(<i>b</i>) the circumferential slip overlying both; and (<i>z</i>, <i>z</i>) the
layers of cement, which may for the present be disregarded.
In order to allow, of the growth of the shell, the circumferential
slip (<i>b</i>) periodically splits in the middle, all round,<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" href="#Page_137"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span></a>
in a line exactly conformable to the edge of the last-formed
slip of basal membrane; and likewise in straight, medial
lines under the spoke-like (cut off in fig. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>) doubled
walls. I have seen, under a high power, the line of splitting,
very shortly after its formation, with the two edges ragged
and near together, with an extremely narrow, new circumferential
slip just formed, between and over the edges
of the previously formed slip. What causes the circumferential
slip to split so symmetrically, I cannot say:
the opposed edges, after a time, become thickened, apparently
from adhering to the underlying layer of cement, as
will presently be described. The circumferential slip continues
increasing in breadth till the period of its splitting
arrives, by which time it has become much broader than
the last-formed slip of basal membrane; and after the
splitting takes place, the interior half towards the basal
membrane, forms a new basal slip all round the basis, and
the exterior half adds a new slip to the membrane investing
the walls. This latter membrane being inflected under
the basal edges of the walls, is, during the growth of their
edges, drawn straight down, the newly-formed portion
taking the inflected position.</p>

<p>In the sectional diagram, (<a href="#p28f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>) the circumferential slip is
not yet broad enough to split; when it has become so, it will
split under the letter (<i>b</i>). The slips of basal membrane are, as
may be seen in fig. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, narrower towards the circumference;
but the two or three last-formed slips, are out of proportion
narrower than the others; and it is certain, from the comparison
of the basal membranes of specimens of different
ages, that these will afterwards increase in width.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[71]</span></a> I
have seen no other instance, in Cirripedes, of growth in
membranes, except at their extreme margins: I suspect
that these last-formed slips are pulled, during the downward
and outward growth of the shell, a little from over the last-<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" href="#Page_138"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span></a>formed
slips, new and larger laminæ being all the time
thrown down, so as to prevent any fissure being formed.
I also suspect that the gradual increase in width of the
circumferential slip itself, is due to the opposed edges of
the underlying and last-formed circumferential slip being
dragged further apart from each other, new and wider
laminæ of membrane being continually thrown down; the
new circumferential slip being thus, also, all the time
thickened, as well as rendered broader.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> In the case of one <em>young</em> shell, I found that the previously-formed circumferential
slip must have split, long before it had assumed its proper and ordinary
width; for the last-formed slip of basal membrane was of extreme narrowness,
and would have to be considerably added to in width, whilst the new and
narrow circumferential slip was likewise being added to in width. This slip
of basal membrane, though so extremely narrow, had its own cement-ducts and
glands.</p></div>

<p>The central slip or rather disc of membrane, is 3/400ths of an
inch in diameter; and this shows the basal diameter of the
shell immediately after the metamorphosis. In the middle
of this little disc I saw, in several specimens, the prehensile,
pupal antennæ; I made out distinctly the ultimate segment
with its bristles, and, as I believe, the disc-segment, which
was 7/2000ths of an inch in diameter; but this portion was
much obscured by the quantity of cement. When the
corium is removed from the inner side of the basal membrane,
the two chains of glands, extending from exactly
over the antennæ in the centre about half way towards the
circumference, are conspicuous. The cement-trunk, connecting
the glands, is thin, and at the further end is always
broken off, by the removal of the corium and overlying
layer of ovarian cæca, into which the two cement-trunks
enter; and without which removal, nothing could be
seen. The two chains of glands form a very large angle,
open towards the rostral end of the shell, as represented
at fig. <a href="#p28f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>, much enlarged; by a mistake in fig. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, the
two have been drawn in a straight line. The cement-trunk
increases in diameter in proceeding from the centre to the
circumference, and the glands likewise increase in size, at
the same time altering somewhat in shape. From near
the lower side (the basal membrane being viewed from
within) of each gland, two cement-ducts proceed, which
pour out their contents beneath the basal membrane. The
orifices of the ducts always exactly face the middle folds of
the two lateral, and two carino-lateral compartments. In
a full-sized specimen, there are from thirty-five to forty
cement-glands on each side, always corresponding exactly
with the number of slips of basal membrane, including the<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" href="#Page_139"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span></a>
circumferential slip, to which the last-formed pair of glands
and cement-ducts belong. In correspondence with the
great number and narrowness of the central slips of membrane,
so are the cement-glands towards the centre numerous
and very small. All the glands, in the more central
parts, consist of a mere transverse enlargement of the
cement-trunk; but the exterior and larger glands, which
are more closely packed together, are more globular or
pear-shaped; and the two ducts (of which the one on the
rostral side is considerably enlarged at its base) do not
come out of the gland exactly at the same level. The
trunk, connecting the glands, runs straight from one to the
other. The ducts proceeding from the outer and older
glands, on the carinal side, are much curved (Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>).
To give an idea of the dimensions of the several parts, I
may state that the largest ducts were 3/1000ths of an inch in
diameter, and the glands belonging to them nearly thrice
as much, measured in the direction of the cement-trunk; on
the other hand, some of the ducts from the small central glands
had a diameter eighteen times less than that of the largest
ducts. Towards the circumference, the ducts that proceed
from the older and larger glands are piled one exactly over
the other—the last formed being the topmost, and all are
imbedded in the corium which overlies the basal membrane:
this position of the ducts, one over the other (which could
not be well represented in figs. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a> and <a href="#p28f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>), is owing to
their all debouching at the same exact point. But the
ducts form the smaller and younger glands, when the shell
had a different shape, are spread out, and are all attached
to the basal membrane. Altogether, the basal membrane
of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, when well cleaned, and examined under a
moderately high power, presents the most singular and
elegant appearance.</p>

<p>We now come to the cement-tissue: this lies on the
under or outer side of the basal membrane; it is not represented
in figs. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a> or <a href="#p28f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>, but only in the sectional diagram,
<a href="#p28f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>, by the letters <i>z</i>, <i>z</i>: it presents its usual character
and appearance, like solid glue or brown gum, but is
obliquely laminated and sub-laminated: it forms a layer,
much thicker than the basal membrane itself, being as<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" href="#Page_140"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span></a>
much as .004 or .005 of an inch in thickness. It is, however,
difficult to ascertain its thickness, from the singular
manner in which it penetrates into and almost blends with
the epidermis of the whale's skin; so much so, that for a
considerable time I thought (not then knowing anything
about the cement of Cirripedes) that this transparent horny
substance probably answered to a corn on the human foot
produced by pressure. But I soon observed that this horny
substance certainly extended into and up the cement-ducts;
and this fact first led me to the examination of the whole
subject in the several genera of Lepadidæ and <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>.
It was not difficult to remove the cement-ducts, leaving
small portions of the contained cement projecting freely up
as points from the general surface of cement. The cement
adheres slightly to the whole basal membrane, but chiefly
to the yellowish rims or edges of the successive slips; and
it is indeed this adhesion which, I believe, produces the
rims; for the circumferential slip, when first split, had very
thin ragged edges. The cement also extends under the
spoke-like prolongations of the circumferential slip, and
likewise some way up the sides of the walls.</p>

<p>The cement-glands, the trunk, and the ducts, except
the two, three, or even four last-formed ones, are all filled
with an apparently solid thread of transparent, brownish
cement, differing in no respect from the cement under the
central parts of the basal membrane. In one instance, in
which the last-formed pair of glands and ducts had apparently
been only just developed, they were so perfectly
transparent that I could distinguish them only under certain
lights, and I could not perceive any contents. The last-formed
glands and ducts always appear very delicate, and
include a tube of very delicate tissue, containing more or
less of granular matter. The next succeeding pair of glands
and ducts are always more opaque, and contain much more
granular matter; which, in the next, or next but one, may
be seen passing into the state of pale brown, transparent
chitine. I have seen some most distinct instances, in which,
in the same duct, the part towards the centre of the basis was
filled with homogeneous cement, and the part towards the
circumference with still plainly granular matter. In the<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" href="#Page_141"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span></a>
successive circular slips of cement-tissue, lying attached
under the circumferential slip and under the two or three
succeeding slips of basal membrane, an exactly analogous
series of changes is presented; as indeed might have been
expected, as the slips of cement are absolutely continuous
with the contents of the ducts. Moreover, if a vertical section
be made across one of the last-formed slips of cement,
it may sometimes be seen to be apparently in the act of
separating into layers, with the lower layers more pulpy,
elastic, and white than the upper layers, which are less
coherent, and show as yet even still less the character of
cement. The cement under the circumferential and adjoining
slips, often presents a peculiar wrinkled appearance, in
lines conformable with the outline of the basal membrane;
but I do not believe that these are real wrinkles, though so
like them; they seem to consist of sinuous threads, longer
or shorter, sometimes slightly branched, crossing and inter-joined,
and composed apparently of faintly coloured cement.
I suspect that these threads are formed by the union and
subsequent drawing out of aggregations of that matter,
which within the ducts is first granular, and then changes
into cement; for at the orifices of the ducts these wrinkled
threads sweep outwards in curved lines on both sides. The
cement in these early stages adheres, with very little force,
to the basal membrane; and with only a little more force to
the underlying layers of cement; in fact, till it assumes the
brown translucent appearance, like solid glue, it hardly
seems to act as cement.</p>

<p>How the cement reaches the skin of the whale, will be
best understood by referring to the sectional diagram
(Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>). When the circumferential slip of membrane
(<i>b</i>) splits, a new circumferential slip will be formed
over it, together with new cement-glands and ducts, and
cement (<i>z</i>, <i>z</i>) will issue from four new orifices, and will extend
on both sides of these orifices, till the ends meet and
become united, thus forming a narrow, 18-sided, continuous,
new slip of cement, with 18 spokes proceeding
from it. I have not noticed lines of union in the cement
of any one slip; but the matter forming each slip, certainly
has proceeded from four distinct orifices. Seeing how per<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" href="#Page_142"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span></a>fectly
successive layers of cement often become blended
together, lines of union or junction, could hardly be expected
to be preserved in the same individual layer. When
the circumferential slip of basal membrane splits, the underlying
slip of cement, which we will call <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, does not split,
but becomes stretched, so that the newly formed slip of
cement, which we will call <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, does not reach the skin of
the whale. As the new circumferential slip of basal membranes
goes on increasing in width, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> continues to be
stretched, but does not split, till at least another circumferential
slip of basal membrane has been formed and has
been split, and till <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> has been also stretched. By this
time, the cement-tissue <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> has assumed its normal structure,
and has the power of adhering to the whale's skin, which it
has now reached, owing to the splitting of the under and
older slips of cement. At the next period of growth, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>
itself will split, and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> will touch the whale's skin and
adhere to it; and this, also, will ultimately split. It results
from this action, that the cement has a stretched, and sometimes
even a fibrous appearance, with the lower edges of the
layers, of which each slip of cement is formed, thinning out.
I have before stated, that the two or three last-formed
slips of basal membrane are formed at first too narrow,
and apparently have to be dragged outwards, over each
other; and it is perhaps owing to this circumstance, and
to globules of cement having first adhered to the under
surface of the slips of basal membrane, that these slips are
studded beneath with parallel little vermiform bodies, sometimes
of considerable length, and furnished with heads, all
directed outwards. These tapering, vermiform bodies have
a considerable resemblance to the threads before mentioned,
which give the wrinkled, concentric appearance to the
newly-formed layers of cement, and have probably a closely
analogous origin: in one case, indeed, it appeared as if
some of these concentric threads were in process of being
drawn out at right angles to their original course. Lastly,
it should be observed, that as the exterior half of the membrane
of the circumferential slip, after each splitting, is
dragged down, and thus comes to invest the outer surface
of the wall of the shell (the wall not being represented<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" href="#Page_143"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span></a>
in the diagram, but standing where the letter (<i>p</i>) stands),
so it must be with the cement, which thus likewise comes,
in an unusual manner, to invest the outer surface of the
folded walls of the shell, and attaches them to the skin of
the whale,—which latter is always growing upwards, and
tending to bury the shell.</p>

<p><a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>Platylepas decorata.</i></a>—This genus is closely allied to
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, and the cementing apparatus is essentially similar.
In one specimen, I counted no less than forty-nine
slips of basal membrane, each of which, of course, had its
pair of cement-glands, and each of the latter its two
ducts. The glands consists of a transverse enlargement
of the trunk, as in the early stages of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. Neither
the glands nor the duct, when old, become filled up with
cement, but only the main-trunk. The ducts are very
delicate and thin; the larger ones being only 3/10,000 of an
inch in diameter. The glands stand some way apart on
the two cement trunks; and the latter, instead of being
straight as in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, are deeply serpentine; the glands
are formed on each bend, so that, though all on one side
are connected on the same trunk, they form a double row on
each side of the basal membrane. The basal membrane (in
the centre of which I distinctly saw the antennæ of the
pupa) has six deep bays or excisions, corresponding with the
midribs (see Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>, <a href="#p17f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p17f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>) of the six compartments; and
the two ducts from each gland, on the right and left sides,
debouch at the heads of the four lateral excisions, exactly
opposite the midribs of the lateral and carino-lateral compartments.
The later-formed glands, owing to all of them
being situated some way apart from each other on the
two cement-trunks, lie further from the centre of the basis
than do the orifices of their ducts; hence the later-formed
ducts are directed a little backwards, or from near the
circumference towards the heads of the deep excisions.</p>

<p><a href="#Genus_Tubicinella"><i>Tubicinella.</i></a>—The cementing apparatus is here less symmetrical;
but this, I believe, is chiefly owing to the basal
membrane being formed of successively larger discs (not slips)
of membrane, thrown down not quite concentrically one
over the other; each new disc of membrane seems to cover
the last-formed cement-glands and ducts; and there are<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" href="#Page_144"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span></a>
as many ducts and glands as there are discs of membrane,
all adhering together. In one specimen, it appeared that
normally there were four sets of cement-ducts, as in the
allied genera of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>; but in other
specimens, the ducts were distributed very irregularly. In
one case the two cement-trunks extended parallel and close
together, one of them terminating long before the other. I
have given a figure (Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f03">3</a>) of three of the cement-glands,
removed from the basal membrane, together with their
ducts. The cement-trunk (<i>f f</i>) seemed to be a little enlarged,
and to be crossed by septa, as it entered the glands (<i>h</i>), but I
could not make out this structure clearly enough to be represented.
Whilst young, the cement-glands stand some little
way apart from each other; and in the figure given of some
of the last-formed glands, they are hardly separate enough.
Each gland gives out obliquely, on one side, a cement-duct (<i>c</i>)
which I traced in several cases to the margin of one of the
discs of basal membrane, where cement issued from it; and
on the opposite side, a tapering spur (<i>b</i>), varying in length,
which may be called, and I believe really is, a rudimentary
duct. Of these spurs we shall meet many instances in
other genera. The duct (<i>c</i>) and the spur (<i>b</i>), close to
where they entered the gland, in some specimens gave off, at
about right angles, short blunt points, or rudimentary
branches. This duct and spur correspond, I believe,
with the two ducts in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>; but besides these, a
duct (<i>a</i>) is given off from one end of the gland, from the
surface opposite to that at which the cement-trunk enters.
This duct (<i>a</i>) is very singular, from always forming a loop
(<i>a′</i>), with two spurs projecting from it: these two spurs
occasionally spring from a common point: I have seen
nothing like this structure in any other Cirripede. This
duct (<i>a</i>) runs, like the duct (<i>c</i>), to the margin of its own disc
of basal membrane, where it debouches. Besides these ducts,
in the best specimen which I examined, there were two
other sets of ducts, which were slightly zig-zag, and at each
angular bend, a mere knob or point, or at most a short
branch, was given off; but this branch seemed never to run
to the margin of the basal membrane or to give out cement;
whereas the main branch did give out cement. I was<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" href="#Page_145"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span></a>
not able to trace these ducts to their glands. In these
zig-zag ducts, and in the rudimentary points sometimes
observed at the base of the duct (<i>c</i>), and likewise at the
base of the spur (<i>b</i>), we see the first indication of that
tendency to bifurcation, so strongly characteristic of the
cement-ducts in all the genera, excepting those already
described, which are allied to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>Chelonobia patula.</i></a>—The cementing apparatus is here
chiefly remarkable for the thinness and straightness of the
main trunk, (<i>f f</i>, Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f02">2</a>), and from the great distance
at which the glands stand apart; had another gland been
drawn, it would, on the scale here used, have stood exactly
under the two upper, (<i>c′ c′</i>) in fig. <a href="#p28f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>. We here see that
the trunk (<i>f</i>), before entering the gland (<i>h</i>), has an enlarged
portion (<i>g</i>); this, I suspect, is a very general structure.
Each gland gives out, on opposite sides, two ducts
(<i>a a</i>, <i>b b</i>), larger even than the main trunk; and these ducts
bifurcate repeatedly, and inosculate. By this inosculation it
is not improbable that all four ducts, proceeding from the
two glands of the same age, may be connected together;
certainly the bifurcating branches from the same duct thus
become repeatedly connected. For the first two or three
bifurcations the ducts decrease very little or not at all in
diameter; but nearer the circumference they become
smaller. The ducts, also, proceeding from the younger
and smaller glands, are, of course, proportionably smaller.
In one case I was able to count four bifurcations in the
duct between the gland and the edge of the basal membrane.
It follows from this structure, that the basal membrane,
at each period of growth, is cemented down by cement
issuing from several orifices; but we shall presently find
that in other genera the cement proceeds from many more
orifices. In fig. <a href="#p28f02">2</a> there is represented, by the aid of the
camera, a small portion (from the outer (<i>a</i>) to the outer (<i>b</i>)
being 12/100ths of an inch in length) of the basal membrane,
with all the several cement-ducts adhering to it, which I
could distinguish, and drawn of their proper relative sizes;
this figure also shows some of the bifurcations, but no inosculation
happened to be included in the space here given; the
basal membrane itself has not been represented. In taking<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" href="#Page_146"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span></a>
a view of a considerable portion of the basal membrane,
especially towards the circumference, some parallelism in
the branches could be perceived; one set of branches tending
to run in the direction of the ray of the circle, and the other
set in the line of the circumference.</p>

<p><a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>Elminius Kingii.</i></a>—The cement-glands here resemble
those of <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, but the trunk does not seem to be
enlarged before entering the gland. The glands are
situated rather far apart; and the chief peculiarity is, that
the trunk connecting the glands is as tortuous as the track
of a worm. Each gland gives out two ducts, which bifurcate
repeatedly, and often inosculate, making, in parts, an
hexagonal mesh-work: some of the branches do not debouch
on the basal membrane, but terminate in blunt
points. So numerous are the ducts, that the basal membrane
may be compared to pieces of paper with the fine
fibrous branching roots of some plant dried and heaped on
it. Some of these ducts are very regularly jointed, and
resemble a conferva,—an appearance which I believe is
owing to divisions in the contained cement; other ducts
are partially marked by little wrinkles, as presently to be
described under <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The cement, instead of, as heretofore,
invariably forming a slip round and beneath the circumference
of the basal membrane, here often forms little,
independent, circular, and irregularly-shaped discs, each of
which has issued from a single orifice. I may here add
that in two species of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita"><i>Tetraclita</i></a> I saw the cement-ducts
repeatedly bifurcating, with some of the branches inosculating,
as in <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a> and <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, which, like all the Cirripedes
hitherto mentioned, has a membranous basis, I could only
make out an amazing number of bifurcating and inosculating
cement-ducts, of very various diameters. The cement-tissue,
on the under side of the basal membrane, generally
consisted of little circular discs, on an average from 2 to 5/1000ths
of an inch in diameter; but there were also globules and
short tortuous threads of cement. In some very much
elongated and crowded specimens—in which, during the
downward growth of the walls, the basal membrane had
ceased to reach the surface of attachment, and being thus<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" href="#Page_147"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span></a>
suspended had become, as viewed from the outside, deeply
concave—the cement had apparently continued to try to
reach the rock, and now hung down in the form of two
thickish roots, some tenths of an inch in length. These
roots were round, and tapered either to a fine or blunt
point; one was doubled on itself, and so had become united;
in the other, I could perceive five layers or sheaths of the
cement-tissue, one within the other; the innermost of these
layers, which once, no doubt, formed the outside surface of
the root, was only a quarter of its present length.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>, the basis is calcareous: when
its upper surface is cleaned, dried, and examined under a
good light, the numerous larger cement-ducts can be
seen, even by the naked eye, or under a weak lens, and
present an elegant appearance. These larger ducts run in
parallel lines from the two chains of glands towards the
circumference. They are all encrusted with calcareous
matter, and in the more central parts are hidden under it;
at each period of growth, when the basis is added to round
the circumference, it would appear that a layer of excessive
tenuity of shell is thrown down over the whole surface, just
in the same way as in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, at each period, a new
and larger disc of membrane was thrown down over the
pre-existing membranes with their cementing apparatus.
The cement-glands, in the middle of the basal plate, seem
often to give rise to small abnormal depositions of calcareous
matter. When the basis (it is best to take a young
specimen) is slowly dissolved in acid, all the cementing
apparatus is left uninjured, adhering to the delicate tissue
which before existed in a calcified condition. Near the
middle I saw the two antennæ of the pupa; and from
them the two cement-trunks extended about half-way
towards the circumference. These two chains of glands are
often placed very irregularly, but they tend to form, as in
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, a large angle, open towards the rostral end of the
shell. The glands, close to the old antennæ, commence
abruptly, of rather large size: the later-formed glands, with
their ducts, are in regular order larger than the younger ones,
and stand much closer together. After immersion in acid
all the glands and ducts appeared empty, instead of the older<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" href="#Page_148"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span></a>
ones being, as in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, filled with cement. In one
case I counted on each trunk twenty-five glands, besides
some smaller obscure ones close to the centre.</p>

<p>In Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>, I have given a drawing of two of the
cement glands: the cement-trunk (<i>f f</i>) is smooth and apparently
cylindrical: it becomes enlarged (at <i>g</i>) before entering
the gland: it seems even to be prolonged across the
gland under the form of a narrow bar (not represented),
which apparently serves to keep the two ends of the trunk,
on the two sides of the gland, in their proper relative places
and distances. The gland itself is an elongated bag (<i>h</i>),
which properly lies exactly over the enlarged portion (<i>g</i>) of
the trunk, but in the drawing has been purposely displaced:
it gives rise, in the later-formed glands, to a sort
of neck (see the upper gland), which is either so long as to
deserve rather to be called a duct and which soon bifurcates,
or is quite short (see the lower gland) and gives rise to
two separate ducts. On the opposite side of these glands,
there is a spur (<i>m</i>), of greater or shorter length, which is
evidently a rudimentary duct, for in the younger glands it
existed as a perfect duct. Moreover, the first-mentioned
duct often gives off branches (<i>t′</i>), having an exactly similar
appearance with the spur (<i>m</i>). The membrane of which the
cement-trunk (<i>f</i>), with the enlargements (<i>g</i>), is composed,
is smooth, but that of the glands and of all the ducts, presents
a very peculiar appearance, which at first would be called
scaled, but more properly perhaps notched,—each notch
being apparently formed by a line of thickened membrane,
extending obliquely round only a short portion of the tube,
and indenting it. The ducts, which I measured, were between
1/3000th and 4/3000ths of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>In fig. <a href="#p28f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>, I have given a drawing of the two chains of
glands, but with only those ducts figured which proceeded
from the last-formed pair of glands. The specimen here
drawn was old; and it is rare to find the structure of the
ducts so simple. From both glands<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[72]</span></a> a neck or thick duct
arises, which soon bifurcates; one branch runs direct into<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" href="#Page_149"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span></a>
the circumferential duct, and the other (<i>t</i>) bifurcates again;
of the latter, one branch unites with its fellow from the
opposite gland, and then forming a single duct (<i>t′</i>) enters,
as do the two other branches, the circumferential duct. Thus,
into the latter, five main ducts enter: the position of their
points of entrance, with respect to the shell, varies considerably;
but I think the five points tend to face the middle of
the rostrum, and middle of the two lateral compartments on
each side. In some other specimens, in which the ducts
were nearly as simple, I observed that the neck or main
duct at once divided into three branches, instead of into
two, with one soon bifurcating; and on one side a rudimentary
branch or spur was given off (above <i>t</i>), indicating
a tendency to an additional bifurcation. In the later-formed
glands, the ducts proceed only from the outer sides
and form the ends of the glands furthest from the centre;
but in the earlier-formed and smaller glands of the same
individual, other ducts proceed from the inner sides, where
in the older glands the spurs (<i>m</i>) are situated: moreover,
in the younger glands, all the ducts bifurcate much oftener
(how often I was not able to ascertain), before entering the
circumferential duct; many of the branches, however, terminating
in spur-like points. Now if we imagine twenty
or thirty repetitions of the ducts given in fig. <a href="#p28f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>, (independently
of the greater complication of the ducts of the
younger glands), each a very little smaller than the other,
and placed, with the main branches parallel, one over and
within the other, we shall gain some insight into the wonderfully
complicated structure of the cementing apparatus
in this and many other species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> It should be observed that fig. <a href="#p28f04b">4 <i>b</i></a> ought to have been drawn with its
present upper end downwards, to make it correspond in position with fig. <a href="#p28f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>.</p></div>

<p>I have as yet only alluded to the <i>circumferential duct</i>
(<i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>): we have not hitherto met with this
duct, but I suspect that the branches which in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>
inosculate, and which seem to run nearly parallel to the
circumference of the basal membrane, answer the same
purpose of connecting the ducts together, and are, perhaps,
strictly homologous. In this, and some other species of
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, the last-formed circumferential duct runs round
the margin of the upper lamina of the basal plate, close
to the basal edges of the walls; and as these latter have<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" href="#Page_150"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span></a>
projecting longitudinal ribs, the duct curves a little round
each rib; so that the whole duct is formed by as many
short inwardly curved portions as the walls have ribs, or
longitudinal septa. Between the basal extremities of these
parietal, longitudinal septa, the extremities of the radiating
septa of the basis project and enter; and along the crests of
the latter, little branch-ducts (<i>i′</i>), proceeding from the circumferential
duct, extend. In the basis, beneath the tubes
formed by the just-mentioned radiating septa, there is a
cancellated shelly mass (which, in fig. <a href="#p28f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>, was of unusual
thickness), and along the crests of the branching ridges
forming this cancellated mass, the sub-branches of the above
branch-ducts (<i>i′</i>) run; these soon become so minute as not
to be distinguished by the highest powers, and thus form
a sheet of cement, which attaches the last-formed zone
of the shelly basis to the supporting surface. At what point
the membrane forming any one duct ceases, the cement-tissue
being alone left, I was not able to ascertain; but the
lower parts of the reticulated slip (<i>z</i>, <i>z</i>, fig. <a href="#p28f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>) closely resembled
the cement-tissue which surrounds the disc-segment
of the pupal antennæ in <i>Lepas australis</i>. The circumferential
duct, here and there, forms little loops, as may be seen in
fig. <a href="#p28f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>: and often two branches, running along the crests
of two adjoining basal septa, proceed from a common point
of the circumferential duct. The cement itself, under different
parts of the basis, appears as little separate discs, as
threads, globules, and as a fine network, but most commonly
as simple layers. As each thick zone of shelly
matter is added round the basis, the exterior branches
of the ducts, between the circumferential duct and the
new layer of cement beneath, are fairly imbedded in shell,
and are for ever hidden, without, indeed, acid be used for
the dissolution of the calcareous matter: so, also, the pre-existing
ducts and glands, and the main trunk, would all
have been hidden, if the layer of calcareous matter, which,
I believe, is thrown down at each period of growth over the
entire surface, had not been of excessive tenuity.</p>

<p>I cursorily examined the cementing apparatus in <a href="#Balanus_galeatus"><i>Balanus
galeatus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>crenatus</i></a>, which have all calcareous
bases, and belong to different sections of the genus; and<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" href="#Page_151"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span></a>
the structure seemed to be essentially the same. In <a href="#Balanus_galeatus"><i>Bal.
galeatus</i></a>, I found the cement-ducts varying in diameter
from 1/4000th to 1/10,000th of an inch in diameter. In <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>,
the cement-glands do not differ much from those of
<a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>; but the cement-ducts bifurcate often
before entering the circumferential duct; and the little
branches, which proceed from the latter, are very short,
and almost immediately, owing to the thinness of the basis,
blend into a slip of cement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I hope to be excused for describing at such length, the
apparatus by which sessile cirripedes are permanently
attached to a supporting surface; for this is the great
leading character of the sub-class, not hitherto observed in
any other Crustacean.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[73]</span></a> It is not easy to overstate the
singularity and complexity of the appearance of the basal
membrane of a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> or <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>: and when we consider
the homological nature of the apparatus, the subject
becomes still more curious: I feel an entire conviction,
from what I have repeatedly seen in several genera of the
Lepadidæ, both in their mature and pupal condition, and
from what I have seen in <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, that the cement-glands
and ducts are continuous with and actually a part of an
ovarian tube, in a modified condition; and that the cellular
matter which, in one part, goes to the formation of ova
or new beings, in the other and modified part, goes to the
formation of the cementing tissue. To conclude with an
hypothesis,—those naturalists who believe that all gaps in
the chain of nature would be filled up, if the structure of
every extinct and existing creature were known, will readily
admit, that Cirripedes were once separated by scarcely
sensible intervals from some other, now unknown, Crusta<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" href="#Page_152"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span></a>ceans.
Should these intervening forms ever be discovered,
I imagine they would prove to be Crustaceans, of not very
low rank, with their oviducts opening at or near their second
pair of antennæ, and that their ova escaped, at a period of
exuviation, invested with an adhesive substance or tissue,
which served to cement them, together, probably, with the
exuviæ of the parent, to a supporting surface. In Cirripedes,
we may suppose the cementing apparatus to have been
retained; the parent herself, instead of the exuviæ, being
cemented down, whereas the ova have come to escape by a
new and anomalous course.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> Rathke has described ('Acta Nova,' 1839, p. 147), in some siphonostomatous
crustaceans, a pair of curious organs, which serve to secrete a substance
that holds the eggs attached together in a mass to the parent's body:
these organs Rathke has designated by a similar name to that which I have
used, namely, the cementing organs or receptacles; they are distinct from the
oviducts, but enter them near their external orifices. As in Cirripedes, the
cement-glands and ducts are certainly continuous with an ovarian tube; and as
they occupy a quite different position in the animal's body, these organs of
Rathke, though in some degree analogous in function, must be homologically
distinct.</p></div>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Affinities_Classification_Variation" id="Affinities_Classification_Variation" /><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Affinities, Value of Characters, Variation."><i>Affinities, Classification, Variation.</i></span></h3>

<p>Under the Order it has been stated that the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>,
are, on the cirripedial type, the highest in the class; that is,
they are the most complicated, but not (to use Professor
Owen's term) by mere vegetative repetition. Amongst
the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, the first section of the genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> may be
taken as typical; here we have the structure of the shell
extremely complicated, yet beautifully adapted for strength,
and for the protection of the included body. The cementing
apparatus is here, also, most complicated. I have divided
the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> into two natural sub-families, the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>
and <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, in accordance with certain differences in
the structure of the shell and of the animal's body:
that this division is natural, might almost be inferred from
the one fact, that all the characters by which the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>
differ from the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, are those by which the
former approaches the family of the Lepadidæ; moreover,
certain anomalous characters in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, as the
supplemental whorls of compartments in <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>,
and the presence of caudal appendages in this same genus
and in <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, reveal this same affinity. The only
objection which I can see to the separation of the sixteen
genera into the above two sub-families, may be drawn from
the degree to which they blend together; thus, as far as
the shell is concerned, <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, in one important internal
point of structure, tends to assume the character of<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" href="#Page_153"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span></a>
the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>; and on the other hand, <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, a
member of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, has a shell, which if not
examined during its earliest growth, would be placed without
doubt amongst the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>. But it fortunately so
happens, that in no one character of the body does <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>
approach the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> more nearly, than do the
other members of its sub-family; or <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a> approach,
in the same respects, the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>. It is only in
<a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, of which the shell clearly places it in the sub-family
bearing its name, that in some of the species, the
less bullate labrum,—the larger palpi,—the lower teeth
of the mandibles being laterally double,—and the lower
segments of the third pair of cirri being thickly clothed,
like the lower segments of the second pair, with bristles—all
show that these species make an approach in structure
to the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>.</p>

<p>It will be seen that I have divided the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> into two
little groups, according as whether the branchiæ consist of
one or of two plicated folds of membrane, and as whether
or not the scutum and tergum are articulated together.
I have been greatly tempted to follow Drs. Leach and
Gray, who have separated the second of these groups, containing
the genera <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, and
<a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, into the sub-family of the Coronulinæ. Certainly
these genera have a peculiar aspect in common, and
agree in being parasitic and imbedded in the skin of Cetaceans,
as is the case with the first three genera, or in that of
turtles, manatee, and sea-snakes, as in <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>. Though
these genera possess several peculiar characters, yet I can
find none common to all four, excepting their imbedment in
the skin of Vertebrata, their double branchiæ, and their
non-articulated opercular valves; and these I do not think
of sufficient importance to serve for the separation of a sub-family;
for in <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, one species has double branchiæ,
one species has no branchiæ at all, and the other species have
single branchiæ; so again in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, the scutum having
only a horny articular ridge, makes an approach to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>
and its allies. I may further specify that the folded walls,
a singular character common to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a> and
<a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, fails in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>; the open tubes and the<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" href="#Page_154"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span></a>
imperfect outer lamina of the parietes towards their bases,
are characters which fail in one species of <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>; the
muscles running to the opercular valves being thinly spread
out, and partially without transverse striæ, is also a character
which fails in <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>; the simplicity of the cement-ducts
partially fails in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>; and lastly, the existence
of small intermediate teeth on the mandibles, fails
in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>: hence, I repeat, I have not thought it
prudent to admit the sub-family of the Coronulinæ though
in many respects a very natural group.</p>

<p>The genera in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> and <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a> are
founded chiefly on the number of the compartments (the
number being apparently due, as previously explained, to
the fusion or abortion of certain of the eight typical compartments);
and secondarily, on the nature and even form of
the basis, and on the porosity of the walls. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>
and its allies, the non-articulated opercular valves and deeply
folded walls come into play. As a justification for using
these characters in distinguishing the genera, and even to a
certain extent in separating the two sub-families, I must
call to mind that the shell, with the basis, is not merely
a dermal envelope, as amongst Molluscs, but actually
consists of the first three segments of the head. The parts
of the mouth and the cirri are of very little service in distinguishing
the genera,—a singular fact, considering that
most of the genera amongst the Lepadidæ could be distinguished
by these organs,—though trifling details in their
structure sometimes come in useful as specific characters.
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, with the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>; <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, with
the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a>; <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>, are genera
of about equal value; though perhaps the two latter are
rather more nearly related together than to the others.
<a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a> is more distinct; it shows some little affinity
to the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, and likewise to the four following
genera. <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>,
are genera quite distinct from the foregoing, and from each
other; yet, as we have just seen, palpably allied together.
Amongst the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>, and
<a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>, are more closely related to each other than
to the other two genera of the sub-family; yet <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>,<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" href="#Page_155"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span></a>
as far as the shell is concerned, leads into the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>,
and <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a> into the Lepadidæ; <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a> leads
towards <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> towards <a href="#Genus_Chamaesipho">Chamæsipho</a>.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>—The discrimination of the species in most
of the genera, offers very great difficulties. I cannot
too strongly impress on any one intending to study this
class, not to trust to external characters: he must separate
and clean, and carefully examine the internal structure
and form of the compartments, and more especially of
the opercular valves. After considerable experience, when
numerous varieties of a species have been carefully examined,
the eye acquires a sort of instinctive knowledge, by which
it can recognise the species, though the character cannot be
defined by language; but I have found that no amount of
experience with some of the commonest species, will save
frequent and grave errors, as long as external characters
alone are trusted to. Not only does every external character
vary greatly in most of the species, but the internal
parts very often vary to a surprising degree; and to add to
the difficulty, groups of specimens not rarely vary in the
same manner. After having given up several years to the
study of this class, I must express my deliberate conviction
that it is hopeless to find in any species, <em>which has a wide
range, and of which numerous specimens from different
districts</em> are presented for examination, any one part or
organ,—which from differing in the different species is fitted
for offering specific characters,—absolutely invariable in form
or structure. I may in one respect even go further, and
affirm, that, if in a species, any part or organ differs remarkably
from the same part in its congeners, then if many specimens
are examined, especially when collected from different
districts, such part or organ will be found <em>eminently</em> variable.
I may instance the antenniformed third pair of cirri in
<a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>Chthamalus antennatus</i></a>, the teeth on the posterior cirri in
<a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>Acasta sulcata</i></a>, the terga in <a href="#Pyrgoma_dentatum"><i>Pyrgoma dentatum</i></a>, the adductor
ridge of the scuta in <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>Pyrgoma cancellatum</i></a> and in <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia"><i>Creusia</i></a>,
and other such cases: hence it will not do to found a species
on a slight, or sometimes even on a considerable difference,
in <em>any single point or organ</em>. On the other hand, I am far
from asserting, that if only half-a-dozen specimens of some<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" href="#Page_156"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span></a>
rare species of Cirripede be brought from some one quarter
of the world, characters beautifully defined may not be
readily discovered. In determining what forms to call
varieties, I have followed one common rule; namely, the
discovery of such closely-allied, intermediate forms, that
the application of a specific name to any one step in the
series, was obviously impossible; or, when such intermediate
forms have not actually been found, the knowledge
that the differences of structure in question were such as,
in <em>several allied forms</em>, certainly arose from variation,—for
instance, in the case of two shells otherwise identical, one
being longitudinally ribbed and the other smooth, a character
which we know to vary,—but I have always used this
argument from analogy with great caution. Finally,
as in the large genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, there is an especial amount
of variation, I have there entered in detail on this subject;
and I hope that those interested in it, will refer to that
discussion, which is almost verbally applicable to some other
genera of the family, as <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> and <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Rate_of_Growth_Exuviation" id="Rate_of_Growth_Exuviation" /><i>Rate of Growth, Exuviation, Powers of Repairing Injuries.</i></h3>

<p>In
my former volume I have shown that the
pedunculated cirripedes grow rapidly; this is likewise the
case with the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>. Mr. Stutchbury informs me that
he has seen numerous specimens of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>
from 2 to 3 inches in height and from 5 to 6 inches in
circumference (and this is nearly the full size which the
species attains), on a vessel which had been to sea only
during one year. At Coquimbo, in Chile, I have seen a
specimen of <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> 1.3 of an inch in basal diameter,
and .8 in height, adhering to a chain that had been only
six months under water. Poli, also, gives the case of some
Balani (probably <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>), which, in about four
months, had attained a basal diameter of 1 inch, and a
height of 1-1/6th of an inch. <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a> is a smaller
species, and of slower growth; for the late Mr. W.
Thompson, of Belfast, found that in three months from
July 3d, certain marked specimens had increased from
2-1/2-3 lines to 4-1/2 lines, which is the usual maximum size
attained in that locality. From other observations, Mr.
Thompson believes that the extreme duration of life of this<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" href="#Page_157"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span></a>
species is about two years: whether the other and apparently
quicker-growing species, are shorter-lived, I have no
means of judging.</p>

<p>In accordance with this rapid growth is the frequency of
the periods of exuviation. Mr. Thompson kept twenty
specimens of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> alive, and on the twelfth day
he found the twenty-first cast-off integument, showing that
all had moulted once, and one individual twice, within this
period.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[74]</span></a> This frequency of exuviation, together with the
durability of the cast-off integuments, explains the astonishing
masses of exuviæ, which Mr. Peach assures me he
annually has observed off the coast of Cornwall; they are
most abundant in April and May, but he has seen quantities
also in September; he could easily, as he tells me,
have filled several quart-measures with them. The specimens
sent to me consisted chiefly of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>perforatus</i></a>, and <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>. The opercular membrane,
with a narrow strip from between the two scuta,
and another narrow strip from between the two terga, are
moulted together, in connection with the more delicate
membrane lining the sack, and investing the plicated
branchiæ. This membrane, likewise, is continuously
connected with that covering the whole body and its
appendages. As I have stated under the Lepadidæ, the
inner tunic of the œsophagus, of the rectum, of the olfactory
pouches, and that which enters a little way into the
acoustic meatus, and the apodemes of the maxillæ, are all
moulted. On the cirri and jaws, new spines are formed
with their upper ends enclosed within the old spines,
but with their lower ends projecting inwards, beyond the
bases of the old spines, and inverted like the fingers of
a glove hastily pulled off. The membranes of the body, in
the act of exuviation, split, I believe, only over the prosoma.
How the neat separation of the opercular membrane, from
all round the sheath and opercular valves, is effected, I do
not fully understand; but it is, probably, analogous to the
splitting of the thick carapace of the common crab. I suspect
in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, in which genus and its allies the opercular<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" href="#Page_158"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span></a>
membrane is not periodically moulted, that the membrane
lining the sack is not always thrown off at the same
exact time with that of the body. In <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>,
in the act of moulting, the opercular membrane is the last
part that separates from the new underlying membranes:
I find that this species can moult when kept in a damp
box out of water. The new membranes of the body,
immediately after the exuviation, are not lax in any extreme
degree. The exuviæ of the genus <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, and of some
other genera amongst the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, can at once be
recognised by the divergence of the posterior <em>four</em> pairs
of cirri: in the case of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a> I have also noticed
that the animal generally dies with these cirri in the same
divergent position. Finally, I cannot doubt<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[75]</span></a> that the
Triton described by Linnæus was only the exuviæ of some
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> (probably <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a>); Linnæus mistaking the
probosciformed penis for the mouth of his imagined distinct
animal.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> In Daphnia, Straus ('Mém. du Museum,' tom. vi, p. 151) found that the
individuals moulted every five or six days.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> Linnæus speaks of the included body (inhabitant as he calls it) of other
Cirripedes, as a Triton; and this, I think, shows that Lesson's conjecture that
the Triton was an Alepas cannot be correct; for Linnæus could hardly have
supposed that a pedunculated cirripede inhabited another pedunculated or
sessile cirripede.</p></div>

<p>I have seen a few specimens showing that when the shell
has been broken it can be repaired; and this I believe
is effected by the growth of a crest of corium between
the broken edges, and the subsequent calcification of this
crest. Mr. Stutchbury possesses a monstrous specimen of
<a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>Chelonobia testudinaria</i></a>, in which one of the lateral compartments
on one side has not been developed. The cirri
not rarely get cut off, but are, as it appears, soon repaired.
I have observed a singular number of examples of the act
of reparation in a group of the Australian <a href="#Balanus_vestitus"><i>Balanus vestitus</i></a>.
The manner in which the cirri are repaired seems to me
curious: the cut-off end is closed by a rounded scale of
yellowish chitine, and then the corium, in the four or five
subjacent segments, separates from the external articulated
membrane, which now serves only as a case or capsule.
The tube of corium thus enclosed, with its contained muscles,
shrinks a little, and soon can be perceived to be in process of<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" href="#Page_159"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span></a>
dividing into new and smaller segments, in one instance ten
in number,—which at the next exuviation would, no doubt,
be invested with an external membrane, and be freely
exposed. In another instance, the pedicel of a posterior
cirrus had been cut off and subsequently closed; in this
instance, a whole, immature, miniature cirrus, with the two
rami, each having fifteen minute segments, was thus enclosed
in what had been the single lower segment of the
pedicel. I have seen several specimens of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>,
as described under that species, with several of the
cirri and the penis truncated; but I believe this was owing
to monstrosity, which seemed particularly to affect the male
organs of generation; for no reparation seemed to be in
progress. In a specimen of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, however, the penis
appeared to have been really cut off by accident; it had
been closed, by a scab, with concentric lines, like the
articular rings on the penis itself; and within the case thus
formed, the corium had healed, and had become pointed,
but <em>inverted</em>; I presume that the point would, after another
exuviation, have been everted, and its length thus increased.</p>
</div>
<div class="no-section">


<h3 class="center"><a name="Geographical_Range_and_Habits" id="Geographical_Range_and_Habits" /><i>Geographical Range and Habits.</i></h3>

<p>With respect to range, the results arrived at have no
particular interest, for the species are not sufficiently numerous;
and, what is still more adverse, the genera, with
unimportant exceptions, range over the world; so that
there is no scale of differences, and it cannot be said that
these two regions differ in their genera, and these two only
in their species. In all the following remarks, I have
trusted exclusively to my own specific identification; and
have rejected all assigned localities which appeared from any
cause to be doubtful. Sessile cirripedes are found in every
sea, from lat. 74° 18′ north to Cape Horn. The area
included between the north point of the Philippine Archipelago
and the south point of Australia, extending on the
right hand to New Zealand, and on the left to Sumatra,—an
area, which, though including two distinct Cirripedial
regions, is small compared with the surface of the globe,<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" href="#Page_160"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span></a>
yet includes a greater number of species, especially of
peculiar species, than the whole rest of the known world.
This is, probably, in chief part due to the broken nature of the
land, affording diversified habitats, and to much of the coast
being rocky. Cirripedes, from requiring to be attached,
cannot live where the shores and adjoining bottom are sandy
or muddy or formed of moving shingle; hence, no doubt, it
arises, that there is such a remarkable contrast in the great
number of the species inhabiting the bold rocky western
coast of South America, and the few species living on the
sloping, and often sandy or muddy or shingly, eastern
shores of this continent. Hence, also, I believe, it is that
not many species have been brought from India. Coral-reefs
are not favorable to Cirripedes, consequently but
few are known to inhabit the islands of the Pacific Ocean.
Where Cirripedes can live, though the species in no
district are numerous, the individuals abound in infinite
numbers: I have walked over the coast-rocks of the Falkland
and Chonos Islands, of Chile and Van Diemen's Land,
fairly encrusted over wide spaces with a continuous layer of
Cirripedes, consisting of only two or three species; in the
same manner as may be observed on many parts of the
shores of Great Britain, and, I believe, of North America.</p>

<p>With respect to the effects of temperature on the range
of Cirripedes, no genus (having more than one species) is
confined to the torrid zones. <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, from being always
attached to corals, is, of course, ordinarily found in the
hotter seas; but one species ranges from the Cape de Verde
Islands in the torrid zone to the southern shores of England
and Ireland. <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> is not found in the colder seas, but
is numerous in species and in individuals, on the southern
shores of Australia and at the Cape of Good Hope. I may
here add, that the two genera with the most confined ranges,
are <a href="#Genus_Chamaesipho">Chamæsipho</a> and <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>; the former has only two
species, one inhabiting Australia, and the other the East
Indian Archipelago; <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a> has four species, confined
to the southern hemisphere, and inhabiting Australia, New
Zealand, and South America. To return to the effects of
temperature; in Mr. Dana's great work on Crustacea, an
excellent chart is given, in which the <em>isocrymal</em> lines, or<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" href="#Page_161"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span></a>
those exhibiting the mean temperature of the waters along
their course, for the coldest thirty consecutive days in any
season of the year, are given; and which lines Mr. Dana
has shown are the most influential in governing the distribution
of marine animals. At the isocryme of 68°,
Mr. Dana divides the torrid and sub-torrid zones from the
several temperate zones; and at 44°, the temperate from
the sub-frigid and frigid zones; but as no Cirripedes are
exclusively confined to these frigid zones, we may here disregard
them. From Mr. Dana's<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[76]</span></a> table of the areas of the
torrid and temperate ocean-zones, on both sides of the
equator, it seems that they are nearly as 337 to 278, in
relative area; and consequently, he remarks, that the marine
species in any class, if distributed equally over the two, would
be one fifth more numerous in the torrid than in the temperate
zones. Now of Cirripedes, taking all the orders, there
are at present known 147 species; of these, 7 have doubtful
habitats, leaving 140 for comparison. Of these 140, nearly
one quarter, or 37, inhabit both the torrid and temperate
zones, as above defined; 46 are found exclusively in the
torrid, and 57 exclusively in the temperate zones; so
that the temperate zones, though less in area, and having,
proportionally, even a considerably lesser length of coastline,
nevertheless have a preponderance in the number of
species. But it should be borne in mind, that there are
<em>two</em> great temperate districts, separated from each other by
<em>one</em> great torrid district; and, inasmuch as the number
of species in any region seems to depend in some degree
on the isolation of the sub-regions, we might have expected
(the other conditions now being, and the <em>past</em> conditions
having been alike), that the two great temperate
areas would have contained more species, perhaps doubly
more, than the single great torrid area.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> 'Crustacea: United States Exploring Expedition,' p. 1476 (corrected).</p></div>

<p>The proportional numbers, above given, are not very
widely different, whether we take separately the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>,
the Lepadidæ, or all together. Mr. Dana has shown<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[77]</span></a> at
length, that generally amongst the Crustacea, the species
which he considers of highest rank, belong to the extra-<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" href="#Page_162"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span></a>torrid
zones: there seems to me in all such cases to be
some degree of vagueness in the attempt to determine
which are highest or lowest, but I have already elsewhere
stated that <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> is, probably, the most eminently
Cirripedial form, and exhibits in the strongest manner all
the characters by which Cirripedes differ from other Crustacea;
as this genus is the largest, containing 36 species,
of which the habitats are known, I may state that of these,
exactly one third, or 12, inhabit both zones; 9 exclusively
inhabiting the torrid, and 15 exclusively the temperate
zones. According to the proportions of the whole class, the
numbers should have been 9 torrid, to only 11.11 temperate;
so that evidently the genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> (in one sense
typical) inclines towards the temperate regions more strongly
than does either the family or the sub-class to which it
belongs.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>With respect to the relation between the size acquired
by the different species of sessile cirripedes, and the temperature
of the localities inhabited by them, the genera
<a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, alone can serve for
comparison: in <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> much the largest species is
found in the temperate zone: on the other hand, the two
largest species of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> are from the torrid zone,
though one of them also sometimes ranges into the temperate
seas: in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, the largest species, and six other
species having a basal diameter sometimes over two inches,
inhabit the temperate regions; and two out of these seven
species, flourish even in the Arctic seas; whereas, within
the torrid zone, there are only three species with a diameter
sometimes exceeding two inches, but two of these frequently
become very large and massive; so that <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, judging
from the size of the species, as well as from their range,
does not require for its highest development the temperature
of the torrid zones.</p>

<p>The greater number of the species of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> have
wide ranges, as might be inferred from the fact of between
one third and one fourth of the total number inhabiting
both the torrid and temperate zones; but it should not be
overlooked, that those species, as <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a>, and, in a lesser degree, <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B. trigonus</i></a><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" href="#Page_163"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span></a>
and <a href="#Tetraclita_radiata"><i>Tetraclita radiata</i></a>, which seem to range over nearly the
whole world (excepting the colder seas), are species which
are habitually attached to ships, and which could hardly fail
to be widely transported. Indeed, it appears to me surprising,
that such species as <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>Balanus psittacus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>eburneus</i></a>, which
often become attached to vessels, should still be confined,
the one to Southern, and the other to Northern America.
But some other Cirripedes, which I have never seen attached
to vessels, have likewise immense ranges: thus <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita
porosa</i></a> is found in every tropical and warmer sea, and
<a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a> ranges round the world in the northern
hemisphere, and, along the eastern side of America, far
south of the equator: <a href="#Balanus_spongicola"><i>Balanus spongicola</i></a>, and <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>Acasta
spongites</i></a>, extend from the shores of Britain to the Cape of
Good Hope: <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>Balanus lævis</i></a> ranges from Tierra del Fuego
to California. I may further remark, that the only two
other species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, and the one <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, inhabiting
Tierra del Fuego, are, also, found on the shores of Peru.
But to show the powers of endurance in some species, I may
specify the case of <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>Balanus improvisus</i></a>, which flourishes on
the coast of Nova Scotia, amongst the West Indian Islands,
in Southern Patagonia, and near <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Guyaquil">Guayaquil</span>. Even more
striking is the case of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, of which I have seen
specimens from latitude 74° 48′ north, from the West
Indies, and the Cape of Good Hope! In these two latter
localities, however, it seems to be rare, and may have been
first transported to them from the shores of Europe, on the
bottoms of vessels, to which it sometimes adheres.</p>

<p>The several species of <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> live attached either to
coast-rocks, or to objects at various depths, down to, as in
the case of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>Balanus crenatus</i></a>, 50 fathoms. <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus
balanoides</i></a> sometimes adheres to rocks or wood so high up,
that it is not covered by water during the neap tides. Mr.
Thompson has informed me, that he once accidentally kept
some specimens of this species out of water for seven days
in a warm room, and that they were then quite lively. This
species, is very easily killed by brackish water, as are some
other species, whilst <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>eburneus</i></a> can
flourish in it; and at the Falkland Islands, I saw <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>Elminius
Kingii</i></a> attached to rocks at the mouth of a fresh-water<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" href="#Page_164"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span></a>
brook, so as to be covered by pure water during the ebb
of each tide. Sessile cirripedes adhere to all sorts of
objects, floating and fixed, animal and vegetable, living and
dead, organic and inorganic. <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> is, perhaps, more
commonly attached to rocks than are the other genera.
Living Mollusca are, I think, the most frequent objects of
attachment: Mr. Cuming has remarked to me, that shells
covered by an epidermis, as Patella, Haliotis, and Mytilus,
are the greatest favorites. <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> is always imbedded in
sponges, or in the sponge-like bark of Isis; <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a> and
<a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a> in corals; <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a> is attached to turtles, and one
species to crabs or very smooth shells; <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>,
and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, are imbedded in the skin of
Cetaceans; and <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a> in that of manatee, turtles, or
sea-snakes.</p>

<p>If we attempt, with our present not very imperfect
materials, to divide the globe into provinces, according to
the amount of difference in their Cirripedial inhabitants,
including all orders and families, and disregarding entirely,
as I think we ought, all probabilities or conclusions deduced
from the distribution of other tribes of animals, we find
that the globe may be divided into the four following great
provinces and one sub-province. I should premise, that in
the following remarks and tables,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[78]</span></a> the species of Lepas,
Conchoderma, <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>,
are excluded, owing to their being attached to floating
or swimming objects, and being consequently widely
and irregularly distributed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> As the number of Cirripedes in the whole class is not very great, I have
given lists of the species in the four main provinces and in the one sub-province.</p></div>

<p>The first, or North Atlantic province, is that of Europe
and the eastern shores of North America, from the arctic
regions to lat. 30°: the island of Madeira, part of the
north-west coast of Africa, and the whole Mediterranean
being included. In this province (the above-named genera
being excluded) we have 31 species, of which 22 are not
found in any other distant quarter of the globe. As some
few of these species range into the West Indies, I have not,
on this account, excluded them from the 22 peculiar forms.<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" href="#Page_165"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span></a>
Had I included the West Indies<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[79]</span></a> in my first province, the
total number of species would have been 42, of which
28 would have been peculiar. The coast of Brazil, even as
far south as the Rio Plata, might, also, have been included,
for I have not seen from it a single species not included in
the above 42 West Indian species. So also, by adding a
single species, might the west coast of equatorial Africa.
The two coasts of South America and Africa, which face
each other within the torrid zone, seem to be remarkably
barren in Cirripedes. Europe has several more species
than the United States, which is inhabited by only ten
species, including even the probably imported <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>
and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>. Of these ten United States
species only two are not found in Europe; and both these
two range into the West Indies, and as far as the northern
shores of South America, and therefore cannot be considered
as peculiar to the United States.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> The total number of species which I have seen from the West Indies, is
19 or 20; of these, only 6 are peculiar to it, or 8, if the United States be likewise
included, the other 12 or 14 species being found in other quarters of the
world. Six peculiar species out of 19 or 20, has not appeared to me sufficient
to institute even a sub-province.</p></div>

<p>I have formed my single sub-province for the southern
extremity of Africa; for although I know of only 11 species
from this comparatively short and uniform line of coast,
yet I was not able to group these eleven in any of the main
provinces: 5 of the species are peculiar, 1 Australian,
3 European and West Indian, and 2 almost universally
distributed.</p>

<p>The second province includes the west coast of North and
South America, from Tierra del Fuego to Behring's Straits:
on this enormously long line of coast, only 22 species are
known to exist, but of these no less than 15 are peculiar.
Of these 15, four are not found south of the torrid equatorial
region, and eight are not known to occur north of
this same region; so that this long line of coast might have
been divided into two sub-provinces, of which the southern
would have been the most peculiar; but as eight species
are found both north and south of the equatorial region,
I have not made this sub-division. Two of the species
occurring on the western coast of North America, seem to<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" href="#Page_166"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span></a>
represent species found on its eastern coast, and in Europe;
thus, <a href="#Balanus_glandula"><i>Balanus glandula</i></a> takes the places of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>,
and <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a> that of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>. Not a single species,
excepting a few which are also widely distributed over
other parts of the world, is known to be common to the
east and west coasts of the two Americas.</p>

<p>The third province is that of the East Indian Archipelago,
and includes the Philippines, Borneo, New Guinea, Sumatra,
Java, Malacca, and the eastern coast of India. Here we
find 37 species, of which 24 are peculiar. I may remark,
that I have received no species from Madagascar or the
eastern coast of Africa; few from India, or from the coast
of China; and I suspect, that on most of these coasts, only
few exist. Probably our third province will hereafter be
found to include the whole Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The fourth province is that of Australia, including New
Zealand: it has 30 species, of which 21 are peculiar. Had
the temperate Australian coasts (<i>i. e.</i>, those south of the
isocryme of 68°) been alone considered, the number of the
species would have been probably 25, of which 20 would
have been peculiar,—that is, if we admit within the 20,
several species which range from the temperate into the
torrid zone, but do not extend beyond the Australian
shores. Owing to the widely-extended ranges of most Cirripedes,
no Arctic or Antarctic provinces can be said to exist.</p>

<p>To recapitulate the above results, bearing in mind that,
although the total number of known existing Cirripedes is
147, yet that the habitats of seven are unknown, and that
eighteen are excluded owing to their being attached to
floating or swimming objects, so that there are only 122
species referred to in the following table:</p>

<p>The least prolific of these provinces contains 22 species,
or between 1/5th and 1/6th of the total number of species, and the
most prolific between 1/3rd and 1/4th of this same number. In
each of these provinces, it is remarkable that the peculiar
species are very nearly two thirds of the whole of its inhabitants.
These facts, I think, show that the above provinces
are natural divisions of the world, as far as their Cirripedial
inhabitants are concerned.</p>

<p>As Cirripedes belong to the great class of Crustacea,
and as the distribution of the latter has lately been fully
discussed by Mr. Dana, it may be worth while briefly to
compare my results with his; more especially as they are
so very different. I should premise, as perhaps accounting
to a certain extent for this difference, that, owing to the
wide range of many species, and the almost universal
extension of the same genera, my provinces are founded merely
on a certain proportion of the species, namely, two thirds,
being peculiar or confined to a region of considerable
dimensions: whereas, in the case of ordinary Crustaceans,
the greater number of the species are distinct even in the
sub-provinces, and the provinces are founded mainly on
generic differences. Mr. Dana divides the surface of the
globe into three great sections, or provinces, the <i>Africo-Europæan</i>,
the extent of which is shown by its title; the
<i>Occidental</i>, which includes both the east and west coast of
both Americas; and the <i>Oriental</i>, including the Indian and
Pacific Oceans, with the East Indian Archipelago, and
Australia. Thus Mr. Dana entirely separates the Eastern
shores of North America from Europe; whereas, as far as
their Cirripedial inhabitants are concerned, they are most
intimately allied, and form my first or North Atlantic province;
and to this, as I have shown, even the West Indies,
the coast of Brazil, and equatorial West Africa might have
been added. It follows, from this similarity in the Cirripedes
on the two sides of the Atlantic, and from their dissimilarity
with those on the shores of the Pacific, that the
east and west coasts of the two Americas form two quite distinct
Cirripedial provinces; though, in the northern half, some
connection is shown by a few representative species: on the
other hand, Mr. Dana unites both sides of the whole American<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" href="#Page_168"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span></a>
continent, into his single Occidental province. The South-African
province is not brought out by Mr. Dana so prominently,
as I have found necessary. Mr. Dana joins the East
Indian Archipelago and Australia into his single Oriental
province, and makes New Zealand, as a sub-province, apparently
as distinct from Australia, as Australia is from the
East Indian Archipelago: whereas I find that the Cirripedes
of New Zealand clearly belong to Australia; and that the
Australian Cirripedes, especially if the temperate shores be
alone considered, are as distinct from those of the East
Indian Archipelago, as from those of any other quarter
of the whole world. I believe that the provinces deduced
from the distribution of Cirripedes, accord better with the
Molluscan provinces, than with those given by Mr. Dana
for the rest of the great class of Crustaceans.</p>

<h3 class="center"><a name="Geological_History" id="Geological_History" /><i>Geological History.</i></h3>

<p>The ancient history of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> is a brief one. No
secondary species has hitherto been discovered; in my
monograph on the fossil Lepadidæ<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[80]</span></a> I have shown that the
negative evidence in this case is of considerable value, and
consequently that there is much reason to doubt whether
any member of the family did exist before the Eocene
period. The existence of a Cretaceous <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> is an apparent
exception to the rule, as this genus has hitherto
always been ranked amongst sessile cirripedes; but <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>,
as we now know, must be placed in a family by itself,
quite distinct from the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>. <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> is the oldest
genus as yet known; it first appeared in Europe and North
America, during the deposition of the eocene beds; and
was at that time, as far as our information at present serves,
represented by very few species. In South America, one
species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Balanns">Balanus</span></a> abounds in individuals in the ancient
Patagonian tertiary formation. I have seen, in the British
Museum, specimens, said to have come <span class="correction" title="In the original book: form">from</span> the eocene
nummulitic beds near the mouth of the Indus, belonging to
the second section of the genus. Generally, the extinct forms
belong to the last section of this genus, which has the
parietes not permeated by pores. During the miocene
and pliocene ages, sessile cirripedes abounded. No extinct
genus in this family has hitherto been discovered. It is
singular, that though the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a> approach much
more closely than do the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> to the ancient Lepadidæ,
of which so many species have been found fossil even
in the older Secondary formations, yet that only one
species of one genus of this sub-family has been hitherto
found in any deposit; and that species is the still existing
<a href="#Pachylasma_giganteum"><i>Pachylasma giganteum</i></a>, in the modern beds of Sicily.
During the epoch of the Glacial deposits in Scandinavia,
Scotland, and Canada, the still existing species seem to
have abounded; and they attained larger average dimen<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173" href="#Page_173"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span></a>sions
than the same species now do on the shores of Great
Britain, or even on the shores of the northern United States,
where the average size seems larger than on this side of the
Atlantic.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_80_80" id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> Since the note to page 5 of that work was written, I have been informed
that the so-called cretaceous <i>Tubicinella maxima</i> is not a Cirripede.</p></div>

<p>Under the genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, I have given my reasons for
never naming species in this large and difficult genus, without
examining the opercular valves: it has been owing to
this, as it appears to me, proper want of caution, that there
are so many nominal species. Thus it is made to appear in
catalogues, that the tertiary seas abounded with species
of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> to an extent now quite unparalleled in any
quarter of the world. Bronn,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[81]</span></a> for instance, in his invaluable
'Index Palæontologicus,' gives the names of 35 Balani,
found fossil in Europe, and I have not counted those found
only in alluvial deposits, as they would certainly be the same
as the still living species. Now I know only 11 recent
Balani on the shores of all Europe, from the North Pole to
lat. 30°; and of these I doubt whether <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> and
<a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a> have been found fossil. In the Red Crag there is
one extinct <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>: in the Coralline Crag, which seems to
have been very favorable to the existence of Cirripedes,
there are six species of Balani, of which two are absolutely
extinct, and one does not occur in any neighbouring sea:
in the Eocene formations the species seem to have been
rare, and I have seen only one, and that is an extinct form.
Taking these several facts into consideration, and bearing
in mind that Cirripedes usually range widely, I do not
believe, if all the specimens of Balani hitherto found in the
several tertiary formations, from the eocene to the glacial
deposits, throughout Europe, were collected together, they
would amount to 20 species. I have myself seen, in a recognisable
state, only 12 fossil species, of which five are
extinct, or not found in any neighbouring sea: I think it
probable that three other recent species, viz. <a href="#Balanus_tulipiformis"><i>B. tulipiformis</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>perforatus</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>, may occur in the Mediterranean
formations; and this would make 15 species. Therefore
in the above estimate of 20 species, five are allowed for<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" href="#Page_174"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span></a>
species existing in European collections, but not hitherto
seen by me; and this, I believe, is a very full allowance.
Consequently, even on the supposition that the five species
just admitted as possibly existing in cabinets, and that the
other five extinct species, which I have seen and examined,
have all been previously named by other authors, a supposition
excessively improbable, even then there would be 15
superfluous names in Bronn.</p>

<p>As affording some standard of comparison by which to
compare the number of fossil species, at any period, in relation
to the number of species probably existing in the
neighbouring seas during the same epoch, I may state that
there are now living and propagating on the shores of
Great Britain, 18 species belonging to the three Families<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" href="#Page_175"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span></a>
included in the above table. I have not counted three
species, in the genera <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> and Conchoderma, which,
from the minuteness of their valves, it is hardly possible
would be found fossil. On the other hand, I have included
in the 18, five species of Lepas, which from floating
and being oceanic, are more likely to be cast up on beaches,
than to be imbedded in sedimentary deposits; so that 13
would, perhaps, be a safer number, as a standard of comparison.
Now in the coralline crag, which seems to have
been eminently favorable for the existence and subsequent
preservation of Cirripedes, and which has been so well
worked, only nine fossil species, as may be seen in the table,
have been as yet discovered.</p>

<p class="p2">The <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> may be divided into two sub-families;
namely, the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> and <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>; and, in the former,
the genera, as we see, may be very naturally grouped into
two sections. The <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> differ from the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>,
as far as the shell is concerned, in the rostrum having radii
but no alæ, all the lateral compartments having both radii
and alæ; on the other hand, in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, the
rostrum has alæ, and the rostro-lateral compartments
radii on both sides, and therefore no alæ. These
differences probably arise, as already explained, from the
perfect confluence, in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, of the true rostrum with
the rostro-lateral compartments. In <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, belonging
to the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, we see an intermediate state, with the
fusion not quite effected: on the other hand, in one genus
amongst the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, namely, <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, we must
look to the shell at a very early age, to find the rostrum
with its alæ, distinct from the rostro-lateral compartments.
In <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>, and <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a>, the carino-lateral compartments
are aborted, or possibly confluent with the lateral
compartments, making altogether only four: in <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>
all the compartments are fused together and form a solid
ring. The sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> is, in one sense, very natural,
as it includes species most closely allied: in another sense
it is far from natural, as some of the species can hardly be
distinguished from those species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, which live
attached to Gorgoniæ: I almost regret I did not merge
the species of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> into <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. In the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>
generally the parietes are either porose, or are furnished on
their internal surfaces with regular ribs, representing the
longitudinal parietal septa, which in other species form the
tubes or pores; there are, however, many exceptions to this
rule in several species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, in <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> and <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>,<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" href="#Page_177"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span></a>
all of which have the parietes of their shells internally
quite smooth, or only irregularly roughened with points.</p>

<p>Looking to the animal's body, in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, the
labrum is always notched in the middle, and is never
swollen or bullate, for the outer and inner folds of membrane
of which it is composed lie close together. The
palpi are large, so that their tips almost touch each other.
The mandibles, generally, have their lower main teeth
laterally double. Of the cirri, the third pair invariably
much more closely resembles, in its whole structure, and
in its action, the second than the fourth pairs; and it is
also generally separated by a small interval from the fourth
pair.</p>

<p>I have already under the Family sufficiently entered on
the relations of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> to the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, and of
the genera, one to the other, so that I need not here add
anything.</p>

<p>I can point out no difference in habits or geographical
distribution between the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> and <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>.</p>

between bright pink and rich blue, purple being the prevailing
tint. The persistence of the so-called epidermis is
very different in different species, being even sometimes
highly variable in the same species. The surface is either
smooth or more commonly folded longitudinally, or sharply
ribbed. The orifice differs in form from diamond-shape
to trigonal; the carinal end, owing to the shape of the
carina, being always sharper or narrower than the rostral end.
The size of the orifice, in proportion to the shell, varies accordingly
as the latter is more or less conical or cylindrical. The
orifice is either entire or more or less deeply toothed, in proportion
to the degree of obliquity of the summits of the radii
and alæ. The radii almost always have smoother surfaces than
the parietes. In some few species the radii are not developed,
the sutures being marked only by fissure-like lines; in others
they are very narrow, and in this case their upper margins
are generally rounded and smooth, instead of being straight
and jagged. The carino-lateral compartments are usually
much narrower than the lateral compartments, occasionally
in an extreme degree, as in <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>. The shell is
generally strong, sometimes to a wonderful degree; but
the strength and thickness vary in the individuals of some
of the species. By the action of hot caustic potash, the compartments
in several species, such as <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>crenatus</i></a>,
separate on a touch; in others, they adhere so strongly as
to prove that the sutures must be calcified together. In
this genus we have the largest known sessile cirripede,
viz., the <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>, and on the other hand many small
species; but it is very difficult, except in well-known species,
to ascertain the average or even the maximum dimensions.</p>

<p><i>Scutum.</i>—This valve is almost triangular, with the basi-tergal
corner more or less rounded off. The prominent
lines of growth are sometimes crossed by longitudinal striæ.
Internally, the articular ridge projects to a very different<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" href="#Page_179"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span></a>
degree in the different species; its lower end is sometimes
(as in <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_688">4</a>, fig. <a href="#p04f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>) produced downwards as a
small, sharp, free style; there is always an articular furrow
receiving the inflected margin of the tergum. There is
always an impression left by the attachment of the adductor
scutorum muscle; and often its lower side is bounded more
or less closely by a sharp adductor ridge, running some way
down the valve; this ridge is occasionally almost confluent,
in its upper part, with the articular ridge, and in this case
sometimes it forms, together with the inflected tergal margin,
a large tubular cavity, running up, as in <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>,
fig. <a href="#p02f03c">3 <i>c</i></a>), almost to the apex of the valve. Almost invariably
there is a slight pit or depression for the lateral depressor
muscle; sometimes within the depression there is a little
ridge, as in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_nubilus"><i>nubilus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_688">4</a>, fig. <a href="#p04f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>, and
Pl. <a href="#Page_690">6</a>, fig. <a href="#p06f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>); and in the case of <a href="#Balanus_vestitus"><i>B. vestitus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>flosculus</i></a>, and
<a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>imperator</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_692">8</a>, figs. <a href="#p08f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p08f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>), there are regular crests for
this same purpose. The rostral depressor muscle is usually
attached in a small pit formed by the folding over of the lower
part of the occludent margin: in <a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>B. imperator</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_692">8</a>, fig.
<a href="#p08f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>) there are regular crests for its attachment, and traces
of them may be discovered in <a href="#Balanus_vestitus"><i>B. vestitus</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Tergum.</i>—This valve is more nearly triangular than any
other shape, with the spur more or less prominent. The
apex generally projects a little above the level of the scutum;
in some species it consists of a triangular and solid, in others
(Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>) of an almost cylindrical, extremely sharp,
inwardly curved, and very prominent beak. This beak is
generally purple; it is sometimes hollow, and occupied by
a thread of corium. Its formation, and the apparent sliding
up of the whole tergum, so as to project above the scutum,
has been described under the family. From an account
given to me by a person who kept <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a> alive, the
beaks appear to be used, when the operculum is touched,
as an organ of defence,—the animal striking with them.
The tergal margin is more or less inflected; and the carinal
margin is convex in different degrees, and, in some species,
is added to by upturned zones of growth. The basal
margin either forms a nearly straight line on opposite sides
of the spur, or more commonly slopes towards it in various<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" href="#Page_180"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span></a>
manners. The spur, or basal projection, is rarely placed
in the middle of the basal margin, generally near, sometimes
close to the basi-scutal angle; it varies much in
length and breadth, and is sometimes even half the width
of the valve. The surface of the valve is almost always
more or less depressed, sometimes so much as to form
a deepish furrow, the "longitudinal furrow," which extends
from the apex to the extremity of the spur. When
the furrow is deep, its sides, as the specimen grows old,
almost always become folded inwards, so as to touch, and
then the furrow becomes converted into a closed fissure: in
this latter case the folded sides generally form a central
crest on the spur. Internally, in the middle of the upper
part of the valve, the articular ridge is more or less prominent,
forming the carinal margin of the articular furrow, in
which the articular ridge of the scutum is lodged; occasionally,
however, this articular ridge can hardly be said to
exist. In most species the tergal depressor muscle is
attached to sharp crests on the basi-carinal corner of the
valve, but these are almost obliterated in other species.</p>

<p><i>Compartments.</i>—The external appearance of the shell has
already been described. In the most typical species, the
parietes consist of an outer and inner lamina, separated by
strong longitudinal septa; these septa are denticulated on
both sides at their bases, but only close to the inner lamina;
in fact the inner lamina is apparently formed by the union,
thickening, and production, of some of the denticuli. As
it is not the innermost of the denticuli on the basal
edges of the longitudinal septa, which thus become united
into a solid layer, the longitudinal septa form slightly projecting,
longitudinal ribs on the inner lamina. These internal
ribs are longitudinally striated; in old specimens
they often become obliterated, especially in the upper part
of the shell. The parietal tubes or pores (occupied by
threads of corium) are generally square and large; but in
<a href="#Balanus_Ajax"><i>B. Ajax</i></a> they are very small, and in <a href="#Balanus_glandula"><i>B. glandula</i></a> often extremely
minute. In the upper part of the shell, and sometimes
low down, they are generally crossed by thin, transverse,
calcareous septa: in some species, as in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>, and
in some varieties of <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>, the upper ends of the<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" href="#Page_181"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span></a>
tubes are filled up solidly with shell. In some varieties of
<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> and of <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>, the longitudinal septa, near
the outer lamina, divide, thus giving rise to a very imperfect
row of outer short tubes. In <a href="#Balanus_vinaceus"><i>B. vinaceus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f07d">7 <i>d</i></a>)
the inner lamina is cancellated instead of being solid, which
is caused by the basal denticuli of the longitudinal septa
being simply united together by their ends and crossed
by transverse septa, instead of being consolidated into a
mass. In several species, as in <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a>, the walls consist
only of the outer lamina with longitudinal ribs, no
inner lamina having been formed; the ribs here evidently
answer to the longitudinal septa in the foregoing species.
In <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>imperator</i></a> the walls are solid, their basal
margins being formed of irregular, elongated points, and
little ridges (Pl. <a href="#Page_692">8</a>, fig. <a href="#p08f04c">4 <i>c</i></a>), which apparently prefigure the
more regular longitudinal ribs or septa. In <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>
the walls are generally either nearly smooth and solid, or
irregularly cancellated; in <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_691">7</a>, fig. <a href="#p07f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>)
two or three rows of short irregular tubes are formed
by unequally branching septa, almost as in the genus
<a href="#Genus_Tetraclita"><i>Tetraclita</i></a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Radii</i>, in all the species, are constructed essentially
on the same plan as the parietes; thus, in the typical forms,
there is an outer and inner lamina, with septa, which,
near the inner lamina, are furnished with denticuli on both
sides; hence the radii are permeated by pores or tubes, like
the parietes; but this holds good only in the first section of
the genus, for, in the other species, the tubes are filled up
quite solidly. The denticuli on the septa often occur only
on one side, or disappear altogether; and, lastly, the septa
themselves often appear merely like little teeth, or disappear
altogether as in <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a>, or occur only near the bases of
the radii, as in <a href="#Balanus_amaryllis"><i>B. amaryllis</i></a>. A slight furrow in the compartment,
against which each radius abuts, is generally
marked by the septa and their denticuli. In regard to the
<i>alæ</i>, their lateral or sutural edges are either thin and smooth,
or, more commonly, finely crenated or ribbed. The little
transverse crenations are homologous with the septa in the
radii and parietes. The edges of the alæ are usually received
in a furrow. The diametric growth of the shell is<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" href="#Page_182"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span></a>
effected by the growth of the radii and alæ, and chiefly by
that of the former. The sutural and lateral edges of both
radii and alæ are added to, either quite up to their summits,
or only low down, and during the continued growth of the
shell, lower and lower down; in accordance with this difference
in growth, the summits of the radii and alæ become
either very oblique, or they extend parallel to the basis,
that is, from tip to tip of the adjoining compartments. When
the radii and alæ are added to, as is most usual, above the
level of the opercular membrane, and therefore above the
sack, ribbons of corium run up the sutures from the sack,
higher or lower, according to the height to which, in the
different species, the edges of the radii and alæ continue to
be added to. The obliquity of the summits of the radii and
alæ varies, in some cases, in the same species. It often
happens that when the summits of the radii are very oblique,
the summits of the alæ are but little so; and the converse;
both, however, are often either equally oblique, or both
have square summits. The <i>sheath</i> extends either one third
or more than half down the shell; its basal margin often
(Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">K′</span>) freely depends or overhangs the inner
lamina of the walls.</p>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—In typical species the basis is calcareous, and consists
of an upper and lower lamina, separated by radiating
septa, forming pores. In the same manner as the septa of
the parietes sometimes, though rarely, become irregularly
divided near the outer lamina, forming outer pores, so it is,
but in a much more marked degree, with the basis. The
basis in such cases becomes extremely thick, and consists of
an upper, thin lamina, with the regular radiating septa
and pores, and of an underlying, thick, cancellated mass,
which seems wholly to result from the dividing and sub-dividing
of the septa. The basal radiating pores, like the
parietal pores, are closed at intervals by calcareous transverse
septa. The basal points of the parietal septa enter
the orifices of the basal pores, and the threads of corium
pass into the latter, between the denticuli of the parietal
septa. In some species, as in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>Hameri</i></a>,
the basis is perfectly solid, the upper lamina being absent,
just as in some species, the internal lamina of the<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" href="#Page_183"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span></a>
parietes is absent. In <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a> the basis is calcareous,
but consists of so excessively thin a film as hardly to be
distinguished: it presents, moreover, as also is the case
with <a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>B. imperator</i></a>, a beaded structure. Again, in some
few species, as in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, the basis is simply membranous.
When the basis is thin, it is always flat, and
is closely moulded to the irregular surface of attachment;
and in this case, when specimens are crowded together,
their elongation is effected exclusively by the growth of
the walls; but, when the basis is thick, it sometimes becomes,
in crowded groups, deeply, but irregularly, cup-formed,
or cylindrical, as in <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>perforatus</i></a>.
In <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>, however, which inhabits massive corals, the
basis is as regularly concave or cup-formed as in the genus
<a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>: in <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a> and its allies, and in some varieties
of the fossil <a href="#Balanus_inclusus"><i>B. inclusus</i></a>, the basis is boat-formed, with its
lower surface deeply grooved longitudinally from clasping
the stem of the Gorgonia or other zoophyte, to which it
was attached. In certain varieties of <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a> it is very
remarkable that the deeply cup-formed basis becomes,
owing apparently to the whole shell having grown too deep
for the animal, half-filled up with irregular, calcareous,
transverse plates (Pl. <a href="#Page_688">4</a>, fig. <a href="#p04f04a">2 <i>a</i></a>), resting one upon
the other by irregular points or pillars. The cementing
apparatus has been sufficiently described under the
Family.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The <i>labrum</i> is always notched; sometimes it
has no teeth, but generally there are three on each side;
in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> there are five or six on each side; and in
<a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>eburneus</i></a> there is a whole row of teeth
(Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f02">2</a>, <i>e′</i>), graduated in size, on each side of the
notch. The <i>palpi</i> are large, with their apices nearly touching,
and furnished with long spines. The <i>mandibles</i> have,
as it appears, normally, five teeth, but the two lower teeth
are always small and often rudimentary, and almost confluent
with the inferior, sometimes spinose angle. The
<i>maxillæ</i> have either a simple edge, or a notch under the
pair of large upper spines, or the lower part forms (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>,
fig. <a href="#p26f07">7</a>) a step-formed projection: there are generally two
lower spines, placed singly or not in pairs, larger than the<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" href="#Page_184"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span></a>
others, with the exception of the uppermost pair. The
<i>outer maxillæ</i> are, on their inner faces, obscurely divided
into two lobes.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The rami of the first pair are unequal, the
shorter one sometimes not being more than half the length
of the other ramus: the segments of the shorter ramus are
broad, and are, together with the lower segments of the
longer ramus, thickly clothed with spines; in some species,
as in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>, the anterior surfaces of the segments,
more especially of the shorter ramus, and of both rami of
the second pair are produced (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f04">4</a>), so as sometimes
to form very remarkable projections. The segments
of the second and third pairs are always thickly clothed
with spines, as also are their pedicels. The third pair is
rather longer than the second; but in <a href="#Balanus_vestitus"><i>B. vestitus</i></a> and
<a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>imperator</i></a> it is much longer, and is otherwise somewhat
different. The dorsal and basal margin of the pedicel of the
third pair, in some of the species, as in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>,
is produced backwards on the thorax, and forms a membranous
plate fringed with fine spines. The three posterior
and longer pairs of cirri have from three to rarely eight or
ten pairs of long spines on each segment, with generally
one or two minute spines in the middle between each pair:
their pedicels have a regular double row of spines.</p>

<p>The <i>penis</i> is long and hairy: in most of the species there
is, at its dorsal basis, a small, sharp, flattened, imperforate
projection; first observed by Poli: but this is sometimes
absent, as in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, though present in the closely
allied <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>; and its presence is variable in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>.
All the species have large plicated <i>branchiæ</i>.
The base of the <i>sack</i> in several species is furnished with
inwardly projecting <span class="correction" title="In the original book: filimentary">filamentary</span> appendages. In <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>crenatus</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a>, and I believe in other species,
the upper part of the <i>stomach</i> is furnished with a circle of
branching cæca.</p>


<p><i>On the variation of the species</i>; <i>their arrangement and
affinities</i>; <i>value of the characters used</i>; <i>changes during
growth</i>.—Owing to the great variation in external characters,
to which almost all the species are subject, and likewise to<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" href="#Page_185"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span></a>
the genus being a very natural one, that is, to the species
following each other in close and natural order, it is not
easy to exaggerate the difficulty of identifying the species,
except by a deliberate examination of the internal and
external structure of each individual specimen. Every one
who has collected sessile cirripedes must have perceived to
what an extent their shape depends on their position and
grouping. The surface of attachment has a great effect
on that of the shell; for as the walls are added to at their
bases, every portion has at one time been in close contact
with the supporting surface; thus I have seen a strongly-ribbed
species (<a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a>) and a nearly smooth species
(<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>) closely resembling each other, and both having
a peculiar appearance, owing to their having been attached
to a pecten. Dr. Gray has pointed out to me specimens of
<a href="#Balanus_patellaris"><i>B. patellaris</i></a>, curiously pitted like the wood to which they
had adhered; and numberless other instances might be
added. Quite independently of the effect produced by
the surface of attachment, the degree to which the longitudinal
folds and ribs are developed on the parietes, is
variable in most of the species, as in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_vestitus"><i>vestitus</i></a>, and even in <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a>; the presence or entire
absence of these ribs often surprisingly alters the whole
aspect of the shell. The persistence of the so-called
epidermis is in some degree variable; and in <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a> we
have groups of specimens absolutely naked, and others
uniformly clothed with a brown membrane. Again, some
species in certain localities are all subject to the disintegration
of the entire outer lamina of the walls; and in such
cases (as with <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>) there is not the smallest resemblance
between the corroded and perfect specimens. The
size of the orifice, and consequently of the operculum,
compared with the shell itself, varies accordingly as the shell
is more or less conical or cylindrical; in the latter case, the
summits of the radii are generally more oblique and the
aperture consequently more deeply toothed than in the
more conical varieties. Size is a serviceable character in
some cases, but very many specimens are required to
ascertain the average or maximum size of each species, for
there is no method of distinguishing a half-grown from a<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" href="#Page_186"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span></a>
full-grown specimen; and I believe, as long as the individual
lives, so long does it go on moulting and growing. <em>Colour</em> is
of very considerable service; though the precise tint varies
greatly in almost every species; and what is a far more
serious evil, the majority of the species have their white or
nearly white varieties, the latter sometimes as numerous as
the coloured ones: in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>lævis</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>flosculus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>,
and in several other species, the common white varieties
are eminently deceptive.</p>

<p>Besides the slight variation in the obliquity of the summits
of the radii and alæ, dependent on the more or less cylindrical
form of the shell, in some species, as in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>trigonus</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>porcatus</i></a>, their obliquity
also varies occasionally from unknown causes, and thus greatly
affects the general appearance of the shell. In some few
species, as in <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>, the radii are often either not at all
developed, or are of very variable width; in others, when the
shell has become cylindrical, or when very old, the radii cease
to grow, and from the disintegration of the whole upper part
of the shell, with the continued growth of the lower part,
the radii at last come to exist as mere fissures: I have seen
instances of this in <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_Nigrescens"><i>nigrescens</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>porcatus</i></a>.
Nevertheless, the obliquity of the upper margin, and the
breadth of the radii are useful characters; and still more
useful is the fact whether the upper margins are smooth
and arched, or straight and jagged. The fact of the terga
being more or less beaked is useful: as is, likewise, the
presence of striæ, or furrows, or rows of pits, radiating
from the apices of the scuta; but to ascertain the presence
of these marks, it is almost invariably necessary to
take out the scuta, clean, and examine them with a lens;
these ridges and furrows, moreover, in some species, as is
strikingly the case with <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, and in less degree
with <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B. trigonus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>lævis</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>concavus</i></a>, appear and disappear,
and vary without any apparent cause.</p>

<p>Now if we reflect that form, size, state and nature of
the surface, presence of epidermis, relative size of the
orifice, presence of longitudinal ribs, tint, and often the
existence of any colour, are all highly variable in most of
the species; and that the obliquity of the summits of the<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" href="#Page_187"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span></a>
radii, and the presence of longitudinal striæ on the scuta,
are variable in several species; we shall perceive how difficult
it must ever be to distinguish the species from external
characters. As some evidence of this, I may mention that,
after having described nearly 40 species, and when my eye
was naturally able to appreciate small differences, I began
carefully to examine varieties of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>porcatus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_vestitus"><i>vestitus</i></a>, &amp;c., without even a
<em>suspicion</em> that they belonged to these species, at that time
thoroughly well known to me; yet in the cases here referred
to, there could be no doubt, when a perfect series
was examined, that the specimens were only varieties. From
this cause the labour of naming a collection is great. Let no
one attempt to identify the species of this genus, without
being prepared to disarticulate, clean, and carefully examine
with a microscope the basis and parietes, and both the under
and upper surfaces of the opercular valves; for I feel convinced,
that he will otherwise throw away much labour.
Moreover, in many cases, it is almost necessary, on account
of the variability of the characters, to possess several specimens.
From these facts, I have not hesitated to form my
sections on characters which require close examination,
though I would gladly have seized on external characters,
could I have found such even moderately constant.</p>

<p>The least varying, and therefore most important characters,
must be taken from the internal structure of the
parietes, radii, and basis: not that these characters are
absolutely invariable; thus the porosity of the parietes is
slightly variable in <a href="#Balanus_glandula"><i>B. glandula</i></a>, and highly variable in the
fossil <a href="#Balanus_unguiformis"><i>B. unguiformis</i></a>; it is also highly variable in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>,
but under a systematic point of view this is unimportant,
as the section including this latter species is well
defined by the membranous basis. The porosity of the
basis is in some degree variable in <a href="#Balanus_nubilus"><i>B. nubilus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a>,
and <a href="#Balanus_patellaris"><i>patellaris</i></a>; and in <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a> we see signs of a passage
from a calcareous to a membranous basis. Characters
derived from the general shape, and from the ridges and
depressions on the under side of the scuta and terga,
especially of the scuta, are highly serviceable. The terga,
indeed, in many species, as in <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>, vary con<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" href="#Page_188"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span></a>siderably,
and are affected by the general shape of the
shell. Unfortunately the differences are not very great
between the scuta of the different species. The cause of
the opercular valves offering more useful characters, as
far as outline is concerned, than do the walls of the shell,
is no doubt due to their being almost independent of
any influence from the nature of the surface of attachment.
Even the ridges and depressions on the under side of the
scuta, which are in direct connection with the muscles and
soft parts of the animal, vary to a certain extent: thus the
length and prominence of the adductor ridge is decidedly
variable in <a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>B. concavus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>tintinnabulum</i></a>, and in a less
degree in <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a>; the size and form of the little cavity
for the lateral depressor muscle varies in many species; so
does the exact shape and degree of prominence of the articular
ridge. There is one character in the terga, which at
first would be thought very useful, namely, whether an
open longitudinal furrow, or a closed fissure runs down
the valve from the apex to the spur; but it is found that
the furrow almost always gradually closes up during growth;
and as a consequence of this, the width of the spur compared
to that of the whole valve, as well as its distance from
the basi-scutal angle, and the form of its basal extremity,
all vary in some degree. The length of the spur sometimes
varies considerably, as in <a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>B. concavus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>.
The parts of the mouth are only occasionally serviceable;
for the teeth on the labrum, and the state of the
lower teeth on the mandibles, and the presence of a step-formed
projection at the lower angle of the maxillæ, are
all often variable. The relative lengths of the two rami
of the first pair of cirri, the degree of protuberance of the
segments, and the number of pairs of spines on the segments
of the posterior pairs of cirri, are sometimes useful;
but the relative lengths of the cirri, and more especially the
numbers of pairs of spines on the posterior cirri, are apt
to vary. Finally, I must express my deliberate opinion,
that every part and organ, internal and external, in Cirripedes,
is liable to some amount of variation in some of the
species.</p>

<p>I must now point out the principal changes which super<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" href="#Page_189"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span></a>vene
during growth, and which cannot properly be called
variations. In the first place, I think, it is scarcely possible
to recognise a species when under the 1/10th of an inch in
diameter. In some cases, as in <i>var. d'Orbignii</i> of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B.
tintinnabulum</i></a>, the shell is invariably coloured when old, but
quite white when very young. Generally the tints become
very much darker with age. Some species, which usually
or invariably have, when mature, longitudinally folded walls,
as <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>balanoides</i></a>, are perfectly smooth in
youth. The walls in <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>, when young, have white,
hyaline, longitudinal lines, and are naked; whereas, with
advancing age, these lines disappear, and the subsequently
formed shell becomes covered with membrane. The summits
of the radii are apt to be oblique in the young of<a href="#Balanus_Capensis"> <i>B.
Capensis</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>psittacus</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>tintinnabulum</i></a>, whereas they are
generally quite square in old specimens. In <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>cariosus</i></a>, and in a lesser degree in <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>, the scuta
become longitudinally striated only with age. On the other
hand, in very young specimens of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, the
scuta sometimes are deeply impressed by little pits placed
in rows. I have already alluded to the longitudinal furrow
on the tergum so entirely changing its character, owing to
the edges becoming, during growth, folded inwards; this
likewise causes a decrease in the proportional breadth of
the spur. In old specimens of <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus, var. sordidus</i></a>,
the whole tergum is much more elongated than in young
specimens. The basal margin of the sheath is hollow
beneath in the young of <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a> and of some other
species, but in the old it is continuous with the inner surface
of the walls. The inner lamina of the parietes generally
loses, to a certain extent, its longitudinally ribbed character
in old age. The basis is solid, instead of being porose, in
very young specimens of <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>. In all the species,
the carino-lateral compartments, in early age, are very
narrow in proportion to the width of the lateral compartments;
and in all, at this early period, the operculum is
large in proportion to the whole shell. The number of
spines on the edge of the maxillæ, the number of segments
in all the cirri, and the number of spines on each segment,
are few in early youth, and go on increasing with<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" href="#Page_190"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span></a>
each successive exuviation: the pedicels of the cirri are long
in proportion to the rami at this same early age.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[84]</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_84_84" id="Footnote_84_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> In some specimens of <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Balanus perforatus</i></a> I made the following enumeration
of the number of segments in the cirri:—</p>

<table id="segs" summary="segments of cirri">
<thead>
<tr>
<th />
<th>Basal diameter of shell 1/20th of an inch.</th>
<th>Basal diameter of shell 1/5th of an inch.</th>
<th>Medium sized specimen about 3/4ths of an inch in basal diameter.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr><td class="left">First cirrus shorter ramus</td>
  <td class="center">?</td><td class="center">11</td><td class="center">17</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Second cirrus</td>
  <td class="center">4 or 5</td><td class="center">9</td><td class="center">13</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Sixth cirrus</td>
  <td class="center">9 or 10</td><td class="center">19</td><td class="center">31, in another 36</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In the specimen 1/5th of an inch in basal diameter, each segment of the posterior
cirri carried five pairs of spines; whereas, in full-grown specimens, there
are six or seven pairs. In the 1/20th of an inch specimen, on the inner maxillæ,
there were no spines between the upper large and the lower large pair of
spines; whereas, in the 1/5th of an inch specimen, there were five intermediate
spines, and in larger specimens nine or ten spines.</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the difficulties now enumerated, I hope
that, owing to having examined a vast number of specimens
of the most varying species, I have not fallen into very
many errors. I have endeavoured to err on the side of
making too few instead of too many species. In those
cases, however, in which I have seen only a few specimens,
I have been sometimes compelled to decide without sufficient
evidence.</p>

<p>I would gladly have divided this genus, already including
45 species, into smaller genera; but so far from being
enabled to do so, I have been compelled to form my Sections
(immediately to be given) on characters not absolutely invariable,
and far from obvious. I was particularly anxious
to separate the elongated species with a boat-formed basis,
which are attached to Gorgoniæ, and which form the genus
Conopea of Say, but I was unable to effect their separation
even as a sub-genus; for <a href="#Balanus_navicula"><i>B. navicula</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_cymbiformis"><i>cymbiformis</i></a>
graduate in the most insensible manner through <a href="#Balanus_galeatus"><i>B. galeatus</i></a>
(the type of Say's genus) and <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a> into <a href="#Balanus_stultus"><i>B. stultus</i></a>, and
this into <a href="#Balanus_Ajax"><i>B. Ajax</i></a>; yet this latter species has even been
described as a mere variety of the typical <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>!
Indeed, so insensible is this graduation, that the first and
second sections of the genus are hardly distinct. I fully<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191" href="#Page_191"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span></a>
admit, that if <a href="#Balanus_stultus"><i>B. stultus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_Ajax"><i>Ajax</i></a> had never existed, <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B.
calceolus</i></a> and its three allies might have formed as natural
a little group, though difficult to be characterised, as does
the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>; or perhaps this group and <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>
might have been combined together. These same species,
viz., <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a> and its allies, are intimately allied to <a href="#Balanus_terebratus"><i>B.
terebratus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_inclusus"><i>inclusus</i></a>, which are contained in the last
section (<span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>) of the genus; and this shows that Dr. Gray's
proposed genus Chirona, including the species with non-porose
parietes in sections (<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>) and (<span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>), could hardly have
been instituted, even if the porosity of the parietes had not
been variable in <a href="#Balanus_unguiformis"><i>B. unguiformis</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>balanoides</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_glandula"><i>glandula</i></a>.
My fourth section (<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>), founded on the basis not being
porose, is perhaps the weakest of the divisions, as may be
seen in the list of exceptions appended to the sectional
headings.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the species is, I think, as natural as
a linear one could be made: every one knows how irregularly
and in how many directions the lines of affinity in
every natural genus branch out. Some few species stand
rather isolated, as <a href="#Balanus_declivis"><i>B. declivis</i></a>; and <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_cepa"><i>cepa</i></a>, and
<a href="#Balanus_quadrivittatus"><i>quadrivittatus</i></a> in a little group by themselves. I have
already shown how the species in the first and second sections
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>) blend into each other; and that the
blending species are likewise allied to some in the last
section (<span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>); furthermore, I shall have occasion to show that
these same species can hardly be separated naturally from
the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>. The first section, moreover, passes into
the third (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>) by <a href="#Balanus_tulipiformis"><i>B. tulipiformis</i></a>; and the third into the
fourth (<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>) by <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_nubilus"><i>nubilus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_corrugatus"><i>corrugatus</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_patellaris"><i>patellaris</i></a>:
the fifth and sixth (<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>) sections are closely connected
together by <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>flosculus</i></a>; and these two
sections blend into the fourth (<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>) through <a href="#Balanus_unguiformis"><i>B. unguiformis</i></a>
and <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>balanoides</i></a>, and lastly, into the third (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>) section by <a href="#Balanus_dolosus"><i>B.
dolosus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a>.</p>

<p>The genus, as we have just seen, is hardly separated
from the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>; by <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a> it tends to pass
through the <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">sub-genus Creusia</a> into <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>; and by
<a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>B. imperator</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>flosculus</i></a> it graduates into <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a> and
<a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>—This, which is much the
largest genus of sessile cirripedes, has its species scattered
over the whole world, from the arctic regions, in lat. 74° 48′,
where we have <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>porcatus</i></a>, throughout the
tropical seas, to Cape Horn, where <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a> adheres to
the coast-rocks. Many of the species have individually very
wide ranges; thus <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a> are
found throughout the warmer seas; but the wide distribution
of these species may be partly due to their frequent
adhesion to ships' bottoms: <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> ranges from the
frozen seas, in lat. 74° 48′ north, to the West Indies and
Cape of Good Hope—a wonderful endurance of the most
opposite climates. <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>Balanus improvisus</i></a>, again, extends from
Europe to Nova Scotia, thence southward to Patagonia, and
up the western coast of S. America, someway north of the
Equator. Most of the species have considerable ranges;
thus of the six species found on the eastern shores of
northern America, five of them occur in Great Britain. Of
the thirty-six species of which the habitats are known, exactly
one third, or twelve, inhabit both the torrid and temperate
zones, these being divided by the isocryme of 68°;
nine are found exclusively in the torrid, and fifteen exclusively
in the temperate zones. Within the warmer latitudes,
and especially in the southern hemisphere, <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> and
<a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a> to a certain extent supplant <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. In depth,
the species range from the upper limits of the tidal zone to
even fifty fathoms. <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>Balanus improvisus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>eburneus</i></a> are
able to survive in brackish water. The different species are
attached to various surfaces—rocks, shells, timber, floating
objects, sea-weed, lamelliform corals, Milleporæ, Gorgoniæ,
and even to sponges. Mr. G. B. Sowerby has remarked<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[85]</span></a>
that in the species from the southern hemisphere it is the
basis, and in the species from the northern hemisphere it is
the parietes, which are elongated, when the individuals, from
being crowded together, become cylindrical; but this is erroneous;
<a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>, in the northern hemisphere, sometimes
has an elongated basis; but no doubt the basis of our commonest
species, as <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>crenatus</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>porcatus</i></a>,<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" href="#Page_193"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 193]</span></a>
from being either membranous or thin, does not become
cup-shaped; whereas this structure is conspicuous in <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B.
psittacus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>lævis</i></a>, the two commonest species in southern
South America.</p>

<p><i>Fossil Species.</i>—Having already given, under the Family,
some account of the geological history of sessile cirripedes,
short as it is, I here only allude to the subject in order to
state my conviction that species cannot be satisfactorily
distinguished in a fossil state, and rarely in a recent state,
without an examination of the opercular valves. Nothing,
indeed, could have been easier than to have affixed names
to many groups of specimens, having different aspects, but
to feel sure that these were really distinct species requires
better evidence than can be afforded by the shell, without
the operculum. No doubt, in some of the smaller sections
of the genus—for instance, in that characterised by a membranous
basis—it would have been possible to have distinguished
some or several fossil species; but such have not
as yet been found. When the specimens are much fossilised,
it is, indeed, difficult to make out the primary points of
structure—namely, whether the parietes, radii, and basis
are porose: to do this it is sometimes necessary to rub
down, polish, and carefully examine, a transverse section of
a piece of the shell.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> The following species might, owing to variation, or to the obscurity of their
structure, without care, be classed in the wrong sections:—in A, <a href="#Balanus_Ajax"><i>Balanus
Ajax</i></a>, from living attached to Milleporæ, is sometimes elongated in its rostro-carinal
axis, and from having its radii only finely porose, it might be classed
in B: on the other hand, <a href="#Balanus_stultus"><i>Bal. stultus</i></a> is sometimes but little elongated, and the
basis hardly boat-formed, and hence might be classed in A. The distinction
between all the species in (B) and the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> is artificial.
</p>
<p>
In sections C and D, I have seen one specimen of <a href="#Balanus_spongicola"><i>B. spongicola</i></a> with a solid
basis, and very young specimens of <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a> are thus characterised, and
therefore these species are liable to be placed in the wrong section, D: <a href="#Balanus_nubilus"><i>Bal.
nubilus</i></a>, also, has part of its base non-porose, and therefore likewise might be
placed in D: on the other hand, the circumference of the basis in <a href="#Balanus_patellaris"><i>B. patellaris</i></a>
is often porose, and hence this species, which belongs to D, might be placed
in C.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="#Balanus_glandula"><i>Bal. glandula</i></a>, in D, the parietes of the compartments, without several
were examined, might be thought to be solid, and therefore this species might
be wrongly placed in F; on the other hand, the fossil <a href="#Balanus_unguiformis"><i>B. unguiformis</i></a>, in F,
often has porose parietes, and such specimens would naturally be placed in D.
Lastly, without care, <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a> might be thought to have a membranous
basis, and so get placed in E.
</p>
<p>
The genus <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, without an examination of the animal's body, might
easily get misplaced in the wrong genus, amongst the species in the last section
(F) of Balanus, yet there can be no doubt that <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a> belongs to the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>.</p></div>

<p class="p2"><i>General Remarks.</i>—This, the first species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, is, perhaps
with the exception of <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>, the most difficult and variable in<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" href="#Page_197"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 197]</span></a>
the genus. There are some other species which vary quite as much
in external appearance; for instance, <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>; but <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>
also varies in far more important points, as in the proportions
and structure of the opercular valves. The difficulty in determining
whether or not the differences are specific, is wonderfully increased by
whole groups of individuals varying in exactly the same manner. I
have seen three most distinct varieties taken from the bottom of the
same vessel, so that I did not at first entertain the least doubt that they
were three distinct species. I may mention, as showing the vacillations
which I have experienced on this subject, that beginning with the impression,
that the above three varieties were really distinct species, after
going over the several immense collections of specimens placed at my disposal,
I came to the conclusion that the above three, and several other
forms presently to be described, were only varieties; yet after an interval
of some months, having to look at some of these specimens again, I could
not but think that I had come to a false conclusion, and so went into all
the details again, and satisfied myself that I had followed a right course;
after another interval, I had to repeat the same process, and even now I can
never look at a group of the beautifully coloured shells with their small
rounded orifices of <i>var. coccopoma</i> attached to the <i>Avicula margaritifera</i>,
or again at <i>var. d'Orbignii</i>, with its toothed orifice and white tips to
the compartments, without thinking that they must be specifically
distinct from the dull-coloured specimens with large entire orifices so
common on ships' bottoms; yet I can produce a full series of intermediate
forms, and I can further show, in each variety, that the several
points of difference by which each is characterised, are variable. I
may be permitted to add, in order to show that it has not been from
indolence that I have combined so many forms, that I had named and
already written out full descriptions of most of the varieties, before
determining to sacrifice them.</p>

<p>Seeing that <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a> are the two most
variable species in the genus, more especially in the important characters
derived from the opercular valves, and knowing that these
species are attached so very frequently to ships' bottoms, one is led to
suspect that their extreme tendency to vary may be due to their being
exposed to varying and peculiar conditions, whilst transported to new
and distant localities. It is even just possible, as may be inferred
from the facts given in the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a> (p. <a href="#Page_102">102</a>) in regard to certain
monstrous specimens of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Bal. balanoides</i></a> having been apparently impregnated
by adjoining individuals, that the varieties may interbreed,
and so produce numerous intermediate forms. Whether or not this
could take place, I am inclined to look at these two species, as in an
almost analogous condition with our domestic animals, which give rise
to such infinitely numerous varieties. It appears to me probable, that
several of the varieties keep true to their peculiarities, as long as they
continue to breed in the same locality; but that when their larvæ
become attached to ships' bottoms, and are thus transported and
exposed to new conditions, they give rise to new and ever-varying
varieties. I will first give a full description of the more common forms
of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, which undoubtedly belong to the same species,<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198" href="#Page_198"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span></a>
only alluding to the less frequent points of difference, and then separately
describe the more marked varieties.</p>

<p><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shape of shell generally tubulo-conical, or
conical, or globulo-conical, rarely depressed. Orifice either large and
rounded-trigonal, or small and oval, either entire or less frequently
toothed. Surface quite smooth, or longitudinally ribbed; ribs of
variable strength, not unfrequently flexuous or branching, sometimes
roughened with blunt or sharp projecting, irregular points, or more
rarely with almost cylindrical, upturned, long spines; the simple
longitudinal ribs are generally most strongly marked in young specimens.
<i>Colour</i>, generally varying from pink, to pink tinged with
purple, to dark, inky purple, more or less striped, longitudinally, with
white or pale tints; rarely the shell is of the brightest rose-colour,
either uniform or longitudinally striped; sometimes it is pale purplish,
or dark blue; and sometimes dark chocolate-purple: the ribs, when
present, are generally more or less white, sometimes snow-white. That
there is much variation in colour, and in the prominence of the longitudinal
ribs, is quite certain, as the two sides of the same individual
sometimes differ greatly in these respects. The radii are generally
rather darker coloured than the parietes, but sometimes they are lighter,
even in the darkest tinged specimens. The surfaces of the radii are
occasionally finely plaited in lines parallel to the basis. In some infrequent
varieties the radii have oblique summits, making the orifice of the
shell to be toothed. The sheath is generally feebly coloured, but
sometimes bright chesnut-brown, and sometimes blueish. The <i>strength</i>
of the shell varies considerably; some of the globulo-conical varieties
are extremely massive. <i>Size</i>; basal diameter of largest specimen very
nearly three inches; height of the highest specimen three inches.</p>

<p>Young specimens are apt to have a peculiar aspect; for their shell
is often strongly ribbed longitudinally, and the summits of their radii
are sometimes oblique. Their scuta are sometimes deeply pitted in
radiating lines. Their colours are generally pale. I have seen specimens
attached to kelp from the Cape of Good Hope, with their parietes
white and ribbed, and their radii mottled with pinkish-purple; I have
seen other young specimens from the Galapagos Archipelago, of a
uniform <span class="correction" title="In the original book: greyish-blue.">grayish-blue</span>.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> generally have their lines of growth moderately prominent;
occasionally they are longitudinally striated, with the lines of growth
flexuous and upturned at intervals into small, sharp, hood-liked projections,
which are symmetrically arranged in straight lines radiating
from the apex of the valve; I have seen this structure in some specimens
of <i>var. crispatus</i> and in <i>var. occator</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>); and I have
noticed an intermediate state in <i>var. communis</i>. The degree to which
the basi-tergal corner of the valve is rounded off varies much even in
<i>var. communis</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p02f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>, <a href="#p02f01e">1 <i>e</i></a>). The articular ridge (<a href="#p02f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p02f01e">1 <i>e</i></a>)
is broad and much reflexed; and often, but not always, distinctly
hooked (<a href="#p02f01f">1 <i>f</i></a>). The adductor ridge is confluent with the articular ridge,
and runs straight down the valve, bounding the cavity for the depressor
muscle; generally the adductor ridge is blunt, and so little prominent
as barely to deserve notice; but I have seen it sharp and prominent in<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" href="#Page_199"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span></a>
one specimen of <i>var. communis</i>, and it is generally prominent in <i>var.
coccopoma</i> (<a href="#p02f01f">1 <i>f</i></a>), and most remarkably so in <i>var. concinnus</i> (<a href="#p02f01g">1 <i>g</i></a>). The
cavity for the lateral depressor muscle is generally very slight; but in
the two vars. just mentioned, and sometimes in <i>var. communis</i>, it is
deep. In <i>var. concinnus</i> (<a href="#p02f01g">1 <i>g</i></a>) there is a remarkable plate developed
for the attachment of the rostral depressor muscle. The scuta are
coloured either dull-purple or reddish, or striped longitudinally white
and blue. The surface is sometimes externally depressed in the line
of the adductor ridge; and in young specimens there is sometimes,
along this line, a chain of pits (<a href="#p02f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>), as in full-grown specimens of <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B.
trigonus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>lævis</i></a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Tergum</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, figs. <a href="#p02f01i">1 <i>i</i></a> to <a href="#p02f01o">1 <i>o</i></a>) is broad, with a generally closed
longitudinal furrow; this furrow is open in young specimens, and it is
often, but not always, open in rather large specimens of <i>var. occator</i>;
it is always open in <i>var. d'Orbignii</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f01m">1 <i>m</i></a>), and sometimes in
<i>var. concinnus</i>. Apex barely beaked, except in <i>var. spinosus</i>, in which
it is sensibly produced. Spur placed either very nearly in the middle
of the basal margin, or when least medial, it stands at above its own
width from the basi-scutal angle; yet in some specimens of <i>var. occator</i>
the spur is less than its own width from this angle. The basal margin
(<a href="#p02f01i">1 <i>i</i></a>), on opposite sides of the spur, either forms a nearly straight line,
or the scutal portion descends lower than the carinal portion, and
curves very regularly towards the spur; this is the case in <i>var.
d'Orbignii</i> (<a href="#p02f01n">1 <i>n</i></a>), and in some specimens of <i>var. occator</i>. The carinal
half of the basal margin generally forms an angle with the spur of only
a little above a rectangle. The spur varies a little in length and
breadth, but never exceeds one fourth of the greatest breadth of the
valve. The scutal margin is broadly inflected, the inflected portion
forming either a right angle, or somewhat less than a right angle, with
the exterior surface of the valve. Internally the articular ridge is
prominent, and is either considerably or slightly curved; it extends
down either about half, or three fourths, of the length of the valve.
The spur is produced for a considerable distance up the internal surface
of the valve as a prominence. The crests for the tergal depressor
muscle are very feeble. In one specimen, in which both the shell and
operculum had undergone much disintegration, the scuta and terga
were calcified together.</p>

<p><i>Compartments</i>: their exterior appearance has been already described.
The parietal tubes are not large; they are generally crossed by transverse
septa in their uppermost part; but they are sometimes almost
solidly filled up by dark shelly layers. The internal surface of the
parietes is more or less plainly ribbed; in old specimens, however, it
generally becomes smooth. The <i>radii</i> have their septa denticulated on
both sides; and they are porose, that is, the interspaces between the
septa are not filled up solidly. The radii generally extend from tip to
tip of the adjoining compartments, that is, their summits are parallel
to the basis; but in three not common varieties, viz., <i>vars. intermedius</i>,
<i>occator</i>, and <i>d'Orbignii</i> (the former of which at least must, without the
smallest doubt, be ranked as a mere variety), their summits are oblique.
I have occasionally met with specimens of <i>var. communis</i> with oblique<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" href="#Page_200"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span></a>
radii; and this is not very infrequent in young shells. Exteriorly the
radii are generally smooth, but sometimes finely ribbed horizontally,
owing to the projection of the septa. The <i>alæ</i> have their sutural edges
smooth; their summits are usually parallel to the basis, but they are
often much broken; in <i>var. zebra</i>, however, in every specimen which
I examined, the summits were oblique. The sheath varies much in
colour: in <i>var. occator</i>, and in a less degree in <i>var. intermedius</i> and
<i>var. d'Orbignii</i>, the portion lining the rostrum and lateral compartments
is much darker than the other parts of the sheath. The <i>Basis</i>
generally has a thick, underlying, cancellated layer. Sometimes the
basis (Pl. <a href="#Page_685">1</a>, fig. <a href="#p01f01b"><i>b</i></a>) is irregularly cup-formed.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with four or six minute teeth: mandibles with five
graduated teeth; inferior point more or less spinose. Maxillæ, either
with or without a small notch, beneath the upper pair of spines; in
the lower part there are two spines longer than those immediately above
them. <i>Cirri</i>, the first pair has the rami unequal, in the proportion of
about 19 segments in the longer ramus, to 16 in the shorter. The
segments in the latter have their anterior surfaces very protuberant.
The second pair is short, with the anterior surfaces of the segments
protuberant. On the thorax (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>), on each side, at the bases
of third pair of cirri, there is a projecting membranous plate fringed
with fine bristles. The three posterior pairs have their segments shield-shaped
in front, generally bearing four pairs of spines, of which the
lower pair is minute; between these pairs there are some minute spines.
In some young specimens from the Cape of Good Hope, and in <i>var.
concinnus</i>, I found six pairs of spines on the segments of the posterior
cirri.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>—This species is extremely common over
the whole of the warmer seas. It ranges from the Island of Madeira
to the Cape of Good Hope, and on the west coast of America, from
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: Monterez">Monterey</span>, in lat. 37° N., in California, to Peru. It is attached to rocks
and sub-littoral shells, to floating timber, to kelp, and to <i>Lepas anatifera</i>.
It is attached in wonderful numbers to ships' bottoms arriving
at our ports, from West Africa, the West Indies, the East Indian
Archipelago, and China. It is generally associated with <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>
and <a href="#Balanus_amaryllis"><i>amaryllis</i></a>. I have already stated that, on the bottoms of vessels,
the different varieties are generally grouped together; and this makes
me believe that they are local. In Mr. Stutchbury's collection there
are numerous specimens taken from a ship which first went to the west
coast of Africa for guano, and then to Patagonia for the same object,
and it was interesting to see the manner in which numbers of <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B.
psittacus</i></a>, a Patagonian species, had become attached on the African <i>B.
tintinnabulum</i>. The varieties from the west coast of America seem
eminently peculiar; we there find <i>var. coccopoma</i> and <i>concinnus</i>; and
a blueish, rugged variety, with peculiar opercular valves.</p>

<p><i>Geological History.</i>—I have seen specimens in Mr. S. Wood's collection
from the Red Crag of England, which, though not accompanied
by opercular valves, I cannot doubt belong to this species. The specimens
named by Mr. Sowerby, in the 'Mineral Conchology,' as <i>B.
crassus</i>, and which I have seen through the kindness of Mr. J. de C.<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201" href="#Page_201"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span></a>
Sowerby, also belong to this species. I further believe that a specimen
in Sir C. Lyell's collection, given to him by M. Dujardin under the
name of <i>B. fasciatus</i> from Touraine, is likewise <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>.</p>

</div>


<h4><a name="Balanus_tintinnabulum_Varieties" id="Balanus_tintinnabulum_Varieties" /><i>Varieties.</i></h4>

<div class="detail">

<p>With respect to <i>var. communis</i>, I have nothing to remark. The
second, <i>var. vesiculosus</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>), is confined to young specimens,
and may, perhaps, be due to a want of calcareous matter. With respect
to <i>var. validus</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_685">1</a>, figs. <a href="#p01f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p01f01f">1 <i>f</i></a> <i>infra</i>), I may observe that some
of the coarsest and strongest specimens which I have seen were said
to have been attached to a surface of iron. I have seen two large lots
of <i>var. zebra</i> (<a href="#p01f01g">1 <i>g</i></a>), taken by Mr. Stutchbury, from the bottoms of
ships, arriving from Bengal and China, and in both cases associated
with <i>var. communis</i>, and in one case with <i>var. coccopoma</i>. I at first
thought that this variety, <i>zebra</i>, was specifically distinct, but now I
feel no doubt, that it is a mere variety; its body was in every respect
identical with that of <i>var. communis</i>.</p>

<p>Nor have I any doubt that <i>var. crispatus</i>, of Schröter (Pl. <a href="#Page_685">1</a>, fig. <i>h</i>),
is only a variety, although the scuta in some specimens have a peculiar
appearance, externally like these valves in <i>var. occator</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig.<a href="#p02f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>):
the scutum is here broader and flatter than in <i>var. communis</i>, and the
adductor ridge is very feebly developed, but we shall see how variable
this ridge is in all the varieties: externally, the sharp, hood-like points
formed by the upturned lines of growth, have a very remarkable appearance,
from being arranged in quite straight radiating lines. This
structure is evidently caused by the same tendency which produces on
the walls the sharp, upturned, irregular points; but it is singular
that the scuta are smooth in some specimens with very rough parietes;
and, on the other hand, bristling with the symmetrically arranged,
hood-like projections, in other specimens on which I could with difficulty
detect only a few exceedingly minute points on the walls. In
<i>var. communis</i> I have seen a few specimens with a slight tendency in
the scuta to become striated longitudinally. The tergum in <i>var.
crispatus</i> presents no difference from that in <i>var. communis</i>. Some of
the roughest and best characterised specimens of <i>var. crispatus</i> appear
to have come off copper-sheathed vessels.</p>

<p>I believe <i>var. spinosus</i> of Gmelin (Pl. <a href="#Page_685">1</a>, fig. <i>i</i>), has been correctly
considered by me as a variety, but I have unfortunately seen only one
set of specimens with their opercular valves preserved: these were
attached to <i>Lepas anatifera</i>. The colour of the shell varies from reddish-purple
to nearly white; the radii are sometimes quite white; the
walls are slightly ribbed. The scuta in the above specimens, externally
were smooth; the adductor ridge was rather more distinct from the
articular ridge than in any other variety; and the terga rather more
plainly beaked. The tubular, up-curved, calcareous spines sometimes
occur only on one side of the shell, and often only in the lower part.
These spines are often coloured brighter than the walls. Their presence
cannot be accounted for (any more than the state of the scuta in the<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202" href="#Page_202"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]</span></a>
foregoing <i>var. crispatus</i>) by the nature of the surface to which they
are attached; for I have seen one set attached to a large rugged specimen
of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, and another to the very smooth valves of
<i>Lepas anatifera</i>. I believe that this form is almost always associated
with <i>var. communis</i>, which is an argument that it is only a variety.</p>

<p>To <i>var. coccopoma</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_685">1</a>, fig. <i>d</i>) I alluded in my introductory
remarks as having so strongly the aspect of a distinct species. I possess
a beautiful group, with a globulo-conical, smooth shell, of the
finest rose colour, with a rather small, rounded orifice. These specimens
were attached (mingled with <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B. trigonus</i></a>) to <i>Avicula margaritifera</i>,
from, as Mr. Cuming believes, Panama. I can never look at this
set of specimens without doubting the correctness of the determination
at which I have arrived. In the British Museum there are two sets of
specimens taken off a vessel, on the west coast of South America,
almost identical in external appearance with those in my possession,
but rather more rugged. Mr. Stutchbury has sent me some specimens
from a ship, direct from China, which are rather paler pink, and more
striped, and come near to some ordinary varieties of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>.
The scuta (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f01f">1 <i>f</i></a>) in the above three sets of specimens agree in
having the adductor ridge more developed, and the pit for the lateral
depressor muscle deeper than is usual. The tergum (<a href="#p02f01l">1 <i>l</i></a>, <a href="#p02f01o">1 <i>o</i></a>) in most,
but not in all these specimens, has a rather broader spur; and some of
the specimens have the carinal portion of the basal margin considerably
hollowed out; the spur, also, is placed nearer the basi-scutal angle than
in ordinary cases. On the other hand, in Mr. Cuming's collection,
there are two specimens taken off a vessel, identical in external appearance
with the foregoing, but which have scuta and terga in every
character exactly as in <i>var. communis</i>; hence I am compelled to consider
all these specimens as mere varieties.</p>

<p><i>Var. concinnus</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_685">1</a>, fig. <i>e</i>) is, perhaps, the most remarkable of all
the varieties; I have seen three sets of specimens from the west coast
of South America,—all identical in appearance, having longitudinally-ribbed
walls, either rosy or of a dull purple, striped and freckled in a
peculiar manner with white. I have, however, seen an approach to
this colouring in some few specimens of <i>var. communis</i>; and the shell
itself offers no other peculiarities. The scutum (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f01g">1 <i>g</i></a>) resembles,
in general shape, that of <i>var. coccopoma</i>; but the adductor ridge
is here much sharper and more prominent; and the rostral depressor
muscle, instead of being lodged in a little cavity formed by the folding
over the occludent margin, has, in addition, a small plate on the under
side, which tends to convert the pit into a tube. The tergum exactly
resembles that of <i>var. communis</i>. The segments in the sixth cirrus
bear six, instead of four, pairs of spines,—a circumstance which I have
noticed only in some young specimens of <i>var. communis</i>, from the Cape
of Good Hope. From these several peculiarities, until quite lately, I
resolved to keep this form specifically distinct; but I have finally concluded
that they are not sufficient. For firstly, I have seen a scutum
in <i>var. communis</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>), with the adductor ridge nearly as
sharp; and this ridge is always strongly pronounced in <i>var. coccopoma</i>;
secondly, with respect to the plate for the rostral depressor muscle,<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" href="#Page_203"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span></a>
although I have not seen this in any other variety, yet in <a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>Bal. concavus</i></a>
a closely analogous plate, situated in the lateral depressor cavity, is
highly variable, and I am not willing to found a new species on one
minute point of structure,—a structure which is variable in another
species of the same genus.</p>

<p>I have seen some cylindrical and conical specimens of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>,
from the coast of Mexico and California, only noticeable, as far
as the shell was concerned, from being rugged, and of a dull blueish-purple;
but which had opercular valves exactly like those of <i>var.
coccopoma</i>, and therefore, as far as the scutum is concerned, approaching
closely in structure to <i>var. concinnus</i>,—all three from the west coast of
America. Hence I was at one time led to believe that there existed a
species on this line of coast, which represented <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, and
which varied in external shape and colour in an analogous manner to
that species. But as the opercular valves in <i>var. coccopoma</i> are sometimes
identical with those of <i>var. communis</i>, and as this is always the
case with the tergum of <i>var. concinnus</i>, and as the shell itself presents
no differences, it is scarcely possible to admit the existence on the
west coast of America of this supposed representative of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>var. intermedius</i> I have little to say in addition to
the character given above: I have seen only two groups of specimens
in Mr. Cuming's collection: the chief interest in this variety is that it
shows that the next form must be ranked as a variety, and not as a
distinct species.</p>

<p>Of <i>var. occator</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_685">1</a>, fig. <i>k</i>) I have seen several specimens, mostly
taken off the bottoms of vessels, and one specimen, marked in Mr.
Cuming's collection "South Seas." After having carefully examined
these specimens, I came to the conclusion, that the slightly oblique
radii—the general colouring, and more especially that of the sheath—the
scuta (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), with their sharp hood-like points, in
radiating lines—and the terga, with the spur so near to the basi-scutal
angle, were amply sufficient to distinguish it as a good species. Subsequently,
however, I found that the scuta in <i>var. crispatus</i> presented,
both externally and internally, exactly the same peculiar appearance.
In <i>var. intermedius</i>, I found the summits of the radii equally oblique,
and the general colouring nearly the same, and more especially a close
approach to the singular circumstance of the sheath differing in colour
towards the opposite ends of the shell. So that the position of the
spur of the tergum was the chief remaining character; and this
evidently varied considerably in the four or five specimens examined
by me, being either its own width, or much less than its own width,
from the basi-scutal angle: the outline, also, of the small portion of
basal margin, between the spur and the basi-scutal angle, likewise
varied much, being either angularly indented, or gradually curved
down towards the spur: so also the tip of the spur varied in shape.
The longitudinal furrow is unusually apt, in this variety, to remain
open. We know that the position of the spur varies considerably in
<i>var. communis</i>. Hence, although the spur, on an average, lies closer
to the basi-scutal angle in this than in any other variety, even than in<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" href="#Page_204"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span></a>
<i>var. d'Orbignii</i>, it would, I conceive, be preposterous to found a
species on this one character. In the animal's body, every part
agrees perfectly with that of <i>var. communis</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, we come to <i>var. d'Orbignii</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_685">1</a>, fig. <i>l</i>): until quite recently
I did not even suspect that this form was only a variety of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B.
tintinnabulum</i></a>: I have examined a great number of specimens in Mr.
Stutchbury's collection, which had come attached on a vessel from
Java, and likewise a few other specimens in other collections. They
all closely resemble each other in shape, and even in size, and differ
only in tint of colour, and in the surface being either very smooth, or
longitudinally ribbed, sometimes with rugged, sharp points. From this
circumstance—from the peculiarity of the tint, with the tips of the parietes
and one side of the radii perfectly white—and from the obliquity
of the summits of the radii, I was led to think this form specifically
distinct. But the colour does not differ from that of some other varieties
of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>; the circumstance of the colour being uniform or
not striped, is common to the sub-varieties of several varieties, and the
white tips to the parietes, and the white borders to the radii, result
simply from the shell, whilst young, having been wholly white, and
this is not rarely the case with <i>var. communis</i>. Dismissing, therefore,
colour, it will be found that hardly any other characters remain by
which this form can be separated from <i>var. occator</i>; in both the summits
of the radii are oblique, in both the sheath is coloured in nearly
the same manner, in both the opercular valves, especially the terga
(Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, figs. <a href="#p02f01m">1 <i>m</i></a>, <a href="#p02f01n">1 <i>n</i></a>), resemble each other; the scuta, however, are
smooth in <i>var. d'Orbignii</i> and rough in <i>var. occator</i>. This latter form,
certainly, cannot be specifically separated from <i>var. intermedius</i>, and
this assuredly is only a variety of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>. Hence I am led
to conclude that <i>Balanus d'Orbignii</i> of Chenu, peculiar as its whole
aspect is, must be ranked only as a variety of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>; its
oblique radii resulting from the same cause, whatever that may be,
which has given this structure to <i>var. intermedius</i> and <i>occator</i>; and
its peculiar colouring to having been exposed (owing probably to
having been transported on vessels) to different conditions, whilst young
and old.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_88_88" id="Footnote_88_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> According to the letter of the Rules of the British Association, Ellis's
name ought to be retained, as it was published in 1758, the same year during
which the 10th edition of the 'Systema Naturæ' appeared, in which edition the
binomial method was first used. But as Ellis himself did not then know of, or
follow this method, it might be disputed whether, according to the <em>spirit</em> of the
law, his name ought to stand. The only other name given to this species is
that of <i>tulipa</i>, affixed by Poli in 1791, but this name had been previously used by
Müller in 1776, and by Chemnitz in 1785, for another species, the <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a>
of this work; and likewise, also previously to Poli, by Bruguière in 1789, for
still another species, viz., <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a> of this work: under these complicated
causes of confusion, I think it is highly advisable to adopt Ellis's name.
I may add that the <i>B. tulipa</i> of Mr. G. B. Sowerby is the <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a> of
this work. It is possible that the <i>B. conoides</i> of Brown, 'Illustrations Conch.'
(1st edit. pl. 6, fig. 7), may be our present species; but without details of
structure it is hardly possible to identify, in many cases, the species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell tubulo-conical or conical: orifice large,
toothed, approaching to pentagonal. Surface moderately smooth,
naked. Colour rosy, or tile-red, with a slight tinge of purple; or
beautiful rich purple. Radii nearly as dark as, or darker than, the
parietes. The portion of the alæ seen externally is generally white.
Internally the whole shell is nearly white. Generally the tints outside
vary in transverse fasciæ; sometimes there are very fine, dark, longitudinal
lines. Largest specimen (from Malta), 1.4 of an inch
in basal diameter; usually full-sized specimens are about three quarters
of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p02f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>) very smooth, with the growth-ridges very
little prominent, sometimes there are obscure traces of longitudinal
striæ; surface covered by an unusually thick and persistent yellow
membrane: valve narrow, with the upper part commonly reflexed:
the basal margin forms, with the occludent margin, a smaller angle
than is usual: the tergal margin of the valve is rectangularly inflected,
instead of being, as is usual, merely bowed inwards. Internally, the
articular ridge is rather prominent. The depth of the <em>slight</em> pit for
the lateral depressor muscle is variable; it sometimes includes a minute,
central, longitudinal ridge.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i> (<a href="#p02f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p02f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>): the longitudinal furrow is deep, with the sides
folded in; the spur is placed at about its own width from the basi-scutal
angle; it is moderately long, with its lower end obliquely
rounded off; but the length, breadth, and precise outline of the lower
end varies a little. The basal margin on the opposite sides of the<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" href="#Page_206"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span></a>
spur, forms a nearly straight line, but with the portion on the carinal
side very slightly hollowed out. Crests for the depressor muscle are
well developed.</p>

<p><i>Compartments.</i>—The radii and alæ always have their summits
oblique: the sutural edges of the radii are deeply penetrated by pores
between the strongly denticulated septa: the sutural edges of the alæ
are quite smooth: the tubes in the parietes are crossed in the upper
part of the shell by septa. <i>Basis</i> tubular, with an underlying cancellated
mass.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—Labrum with the teeth either absent or very small: mandibles
with the fourth and fifth teeth rudimentary: maxillæ with a
small notch under the two upper spines; near the lower angle, two
spines, one beneath the other, are larger even than the upper pair;
beneath the lower pair, there is a tuft of fine spines. <i>Cirri</i>, segments
protuberant in one ramus of the first cirrus and in both rami of the
second cirrus; posterior cirri with the segments short and broad, each
bearing three pairs of spines, with a small intermediate tuft.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species in all essential respects comes very near to
the three last varieties of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, which have the orifices of
their shells toothed. The smoothness of the scutum, with its persistent
epidermis,—its peculiar shape,—its small and not reflexed
articular ridge,—together with the crests on the tergum for the depressor
muscles, are sufficient diagnostic characters. Even in general
habit and tint of colour, this species has a different aspect from <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>.
In some respects <a href="#Balanus_tulipiformis"><i>B. tulipiformis</i></a> leads into the species
included in the third section of the genus.</p>

Coquimbo; and in a superficial, recent bed at S. Josef, in Patagonia.</p>
</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General appearance.</i>—Shell either almost cylindrical or steeply
conical, generally flesh-coloured, sometimes pale pink; surface either
smooth (when not disintegrated) or sometimes with the parietes distinctly
and rather strongly ribbed, with the ribs distant from each
other: I have seen six or seven ribs on the rostrum alone. The orifice
in the most perfect specimens is nearly equilateral and hexagonal.
The radii generally are very broad, but occasionally quite narrow, and
even linear. The basis is generally deeply and irregularly cup-formed.</p>

<p><i>Size.</i>—This is the largest species in the family: I have seen a
specimen six inches in length and three and a half in diameter; and
another specimen no less than nine in length, though only two and a
half inches in diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—In full-sized specimens the surface is finely striated longitudinally,
caused by the lines of growth being minutely sinuous;
but in young specimens, until they attain a basal diameter of above
half an inch, the surface is smooth. The valve is transversely arched,
a line of flexure running from the apex to the basal margin, at about
one third of the width of the valve from the tergal margin. The basal
margin is curved nearly continuously, and extends nearly half-way up
the valve; hence the basi-tergal corner is largely rounded off. The
articular ridge is but little prominent, and is not reflexed: the articular
furrow is very narrow. The adductor ridge consists of a sharp, much-projecting
plate, running down close to the basal margin, and is confluent
with the lower part of the articular ridge. This plate and the
inflected tergal margin of the valve, together form a large and deep
cavity, which extends up almost to the apex of the valve. The
depressor muscle is attached in the middle, at the lower, open end of
this cavity.</p>

<p><i>Terga.</i>—These are strongly beaked, the beak being from one third
to one fourth of the total length of the valve, including the spur: the
beak is very sharp, somewhat flattened, and bowed; when young, and
when well preserved, it is coloured purple: it is penetrated by a fine
tubular cavity, occupied by a thread of corium, which extends about
half-way up it. The whole valve is narrow, being about thrice as long
as wide. The spur is also long and narrow; it is seated at less than
its own width from the basi-scutal angle. The scutal margin is not
much inflected. The longitudinal furrow has its sides, in full-grown
specimens, closely folded together. The basal margin slopes down on
both sides to the spur. There are no crests, or only traces of them,
for the attachment of the depressor muscle. Internally, the spur is
prolonged, as a prominent ridge, upwards to the beak, and serves as an
articular ridge. In the middle, in the upper part (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>, fig. <a href="#p02f03d">3 <i>d</i></a>),
between this articular ridge and the carinal margin, there is a second
narrow ridge, which extends from the lower part of the beak half-way
down the valve, and then dies out. The space between these two
ridges, and the ridges themselves, are coloured purple, and consist of<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" href="#Page_208"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span></a>
harder shell than the rest of the valve; hence, when the outer surface
and the adjoining scutal and carinal margins disintegrate, this part
remains, and so forms the beaked, purple apex.</p>

<p><i>Compartments.</i>—The parietal tubes are unusually large in proportion
to the size of the shell, and run up to the summit without any
transverse septa: the longitudinal septa are strongly denticulated.
The radii are penetrated by large tubes; their septa are very strongly
denticulated, and the denticuli themselves often subdivide and branch
out at their extremities. The sutural edges of the alæ are smooth, or
with a high power can just be seen to be crenated. The radii are
generally very highly developed, so that their summits are even wider
than the bases of the parietes; but, on the other hand, in some few
large specimens, the radii are either very narrow or absolutely linear.
In these latter cases, the diametric growth has nearly or altogether
ceased, whilst the walls of the shell have continued to be added to
at their bases, their summits at the same time suffering disintegration;
and thus the orifice has increased in size.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i> generally, and occasionally very deeply, cup-formed. An
unusually thick cancellated layer in most cases forms the under side
of the basis.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—Labrum apparently without teeth, or with very minute
ones: mandibles with three teeth, of which the third is thicker than
the first or upper one: the fourth and fifth teeth are confluent with the
inferior angle. The maxillæ have a small notch under the upper pair
of spines; inferior part projecting and supporting two spines, placed
one below the other, and equalling in size the upper pair. <i>Cirri</i>: the
rami of the first cirrus are unequal by four or five segments; shorter
ramus and both rami of the second cirrus with the segments extremely
protuberant: posterior cirri not much elongated, with the segments
rather broad, supporting six pairs of spines.</p>

<p><i>General Remarks.</i>—This, which is much the largest known species
of the genus, ranges from Peru (Arica being the most northern spot,
whence I have seen specimens), along the coast of Chile, where it is
very abundant at a few fathoms' depth, at least as far south as
Southern Chiloe; it is said by Captain King to attain the largest size
at Conception. On the coast of Eastern Patagonia, I dredged up this
species from nineteen fathoms, in lat. 49°. In lat. 42° (S. Josef), on
the same eastern coast, I found fossil specimens in beds of sand
upraised between eighty and one hundred feet. In the tertiary formation
at Coquimbo, in Chile, it occurs in the middle bed, associated
with the recent <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a>, and with various mollusca, all of which are
apparently extinct, indicating that the formation is of considerable
antiquity. In the living state, on the coast of Chile, it is often
associated with <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a>. As it frequently adheres to large specimens
of the Concholepas, it must sometimes be an inhabitant of shallow
water. I have seen one specimen attached to <i>Mytilus Magellanicus</i>.
Mr. Cuming believes that about six fathoms is the usual depth at
which it lives. Numerous specimens are often congregated together
into great masses. Mr. Stutchbury has some interesting specimens
which he procured from a ship that had first sailed to Ichaboe, on<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" href="#Page_209"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span></a>
the coast of Africa, and afterwards to Patagonia; consequently numerous
specimens of <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> had become attached on <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>,
and subsequently during the voyage home, some few of the
latter again had adhered on <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>: the contrast in the paler
colour and hexagonal orifice of this species, with the darker tints and
more trigonal orifice of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a> was striking. At Coquimbo,
in Chile, I procured a specimen of <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>, attached to a chain
cable which had been in the water only six months; this specimen
measured 1.3 of an inch in basal diameter, and .8 in height: this
shows a rapid rate of growth. Lastly, I may mention that it is
asserted by Molina, and I am assured by Mr. Cuming that the statement
is perfectly correct, that this <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, when cooked, is universally
esteemed as a delicious article of food.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2">This species comes extremely close to the South American <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>,
and I should hardly have attached a specific name to it, had I
not examined many specimens, young and old, of the true <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>,
from Peru, Chile, and Eastern Patagonia, and found them
all identical in the few, apparently trifling points, in which that
species differs from <a href="#Balanus_Capensis"><i>B. capensis</i></a>. The animal's body and the shell
agree in every respect, excepting that the shell is decidedly pinker,
being often most distinctly and prettily striped longitudinally with
pale and bright pink. In some of the specimens the basis is cup-formed:
in some, the broad radii are pale pink, in others they are quite
white, and in this latter case a singular aspect is given to the pinkish
varieties. In very large specimens (and I have seen one fully two
inches in basal diameter) the pink colour is extremely feeble, and the
whole shell has a very rugged, disintegrated, coarse, and sometimes
dirty appearance: in most of these large specimens the walls are more
massive than in <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>, and the orifice of the shell rather smaller;
in some, however, the walls certainly are of unusual thinness.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> differ from those of <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> only in the basi-tergal<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" href="#Page_210"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span></a>
corner not being so much rounded off, and consequently in the articular
ridge, which is rather more reflexed, descending in proportion
lower down the valve: the cavity at the basi-tergal corner is in proportion
broader. The valves in the two species differ, also, but only in
young specimens, in the occludent half being tinted, both externally
and internally, purple, whereas in <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> the whole valve, at all
ages, is white. In the <i>terga</i> the spur is removed fully its own width
from the basi-scutal angle, whereas it is not half this distance in
<a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>. The scutal margin is here much more inflected. In
<a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> there is a remarkable patch of purple on the inside of the
valve, between the articular ridge and a second special ridge; of this
purple patch there is here no trace, consequently the beak or apex is
white. The beak, also, is less prominent. The special ridge, just
alluded to, here runs much nearer to the articular ridge, and is less
prominent: indeed, in old specimens, it is often almost obliterated.
Finally, the whole valve, in proportion to the Scutum, is rather broader.</p>

<p>I have seen a young specimen, about a quarter of an inch in basal
diameter, with the orifice of the shell toothed owing to the obliquity
of the summits of the radii; and this gave the shell a very peculiar
aspect. The largest well-coloured specimen which I have seen is 1.2
of an inch in basal diameter; but in Mr. Cuming's collection there are
two rugged, disintegrated specimens, two inches in basal diameter, and
two and a half in height. Some specimens, 1.3 in basal diameter, in
Mr. Stutchbury's collection, are remarkable from the radii having
been obliterated—the shell being merely divided by six sutures, as we
have seen is likewise sometimes the case with large specimens of
<a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>.</p>

<p>This species is evidently a South African representative of the South
American <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">There can be no doubt that this species is the <a href="#Balanus_Nigrescens"><i>B. nigrescens</i></a>
in Chenu, who had access to Lamarck's original specimens;
and there can be equally little doubt that it is the <i>B. gigas</i>
of Ranzani, collected, during Baudin's expedition, at King
George's Sound: it is essentially allied to <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>, but
in external appearance strikingly resembles some of the
varieties of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shape tubulo-conical: walls smooth, sometimes
longitudinally ribbed: colour <span class="correction" title="In the original book: ashy-grey">ashy-gray</span> tinged with blue, but
many specimens are dark purplish-blue, owing to the disintegration of
the outer lamina, and consequent exposure of the almost solidly filled
up, dark blueish parietal tubes; on the other hand, some specimens
are quite white. Ranzani describes the colour as earthy-violet, which
is very characteristic of some of the specimens. The orifice is apt to
be rather small, compared to the size of the specimens, and tends to be
hexagonal. The radii are often rather narrow. The opercular valves
are tinted pale blue. The basal diameter of the largest specimen is
two inches, and its height two and a quarter.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> have their basi-tergal corner much rounded off, as in
<a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>, so that the tergal margin does not extend more than half
down the valve. The surface is somewhat prominent, along a line
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: runing">running</span> from the apex to the point of chief curvature in the basal
margin. The surface is not striated. Internally, the articular ridge
is little prominent, and not reflexed; the lower end depends as a free,
sharp style or point. The adductor ridge is moderately sharp, and
stands some little way distant from the articular ridge: it is produced
downwards, and forms a moderately deep and large cavity for the depressor
muscle; but this cavity is not closed, and does not extend up,
as in the two last species, to the apex of the valve.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>, narrow, with a sharp, prominent, needle-like beak. Spur,
long, narrow, placed at less than its own width from the basi-scutal
angle: the basal margin on both sides slopes down to the spur: the
scutal margin is not inflected. Internally, the articular ridge is very
feebly developed, but extends down close to the basi-scutal angle. On
the under surface in the upper part of the valve, there is a short, very
slight ridge, extending on the carinal side, near and parallel to the
articular ridge; this slight ridge plays an important part, as in the
two foregoing species, in the formation of the beak or apex. Crests
for the depressor muscle are hardly distinguishable.</p>

<p>The <i>Walls</i> appear to vary in some degree in strength and thickness;
as is likewise the case with the opercular valves. In some of the
thinner specimens, the parietal tubes are large, and the longitudinal
septa are furnished with small, sharp denticula. The tubes are often
thickly lined or almost filled up solidly with blue shell; they are not
crossed by transverse septa.</p>

<p>The <i>Radii</i> vary in width; externally they are often finely ribbed
transversely, at other times they are smooth; their septa are fine and<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" href="#Page_212"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span></a>
thin, with their delicate denticuli not extending to the outer lamina:
they are very porose. The <i>alæ</i> have their summits parallel to the basis;
their sutural edges are most finely crenated. The sheath is blueish,
excepting the wedge-like portions of the alæ which have been added
during the diametric growth, and these are white.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum without teeth: mandibles with five sharp teeth:
maxillæ with the edge straight. <i>Cirri</i>, first pair with the rami very
slightly unequal; segments of the shorter ramus and of both rami of
the second pair protuberant: posterior cirri with the segments shield-shaped
in front, bearing four pairs of spines, of which the upper pair
is much longer than the lower pairs; each pair has a small intermediate
tuft of minute spines.</p>

walls rather thin, coloured, together with the radii and operculum, dark
purplish-brown; sheath nearly colourless. Walls smooth, slightly
irregular, very finely striated longitudinally. Basal diameter of largest
specimen .8 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves</i>, unusually smooth, that is without prominent
growth-ridges. <i>Scuta</i>, finely striated longitudinally, with the sharp
striæ closely approximate. The teeth on the occludent margin are sharp,
and stand some way apart from each other. Internally, the whole
surface is remarkably flat and smooth: the articular ridge is of moderate
breadth, and slightly reflexed: there is no adductor ridge, and the
oval depression for the lateral depressor muscle is extremely slight.
<i>Terga</i>, with the longitudinal furrow very slight; the bottom of this
furrow is feebly striated longitudinally, and there is a trace of a fine,
rounded ridge on the scutal margin, as in <a href="#Balanus_decorus"><i>B. decorus</i></a>. The basal margin
slopes on both sides towards the spur, which is of moderate length and
breadth, with its lower end truncated and parallel to the carino-basal
margin; the spur stands at about once and a half its own width from
the basi-scutal angle. Internally, the valve is lined by very dark,
purplish-brown corium; the articular ridge is prominent; in the upper
part of the valve, parallel to the articular ridge, there are two or three
feeble ridges; there are no crests for the tergal depressores.</p>

<p>The <i>Parietes</i>, though moderately thick, yet are light and fragile; the
denticuli at the bases of the longitudinal septa are prominent, and those
on the adjoining septa are united together, making a <span class="correction" title="In the original book: net-work">network</span> (Pl. <a href="#Page_686">2</a>,
fig. <a href="#p02f07d">7 <i>d</i></a>), but the interspaces between them are not filled up by solid
calcareous matter (as is the case with every other species of the genus),
but are only crossed at successive levels by fine transverse calcareous
septa; the internal lamina thus becoming cancellated, and, though
thick, fragile. Hence, in a transverse section of the parietes, the
ordinary parietal tubes or pores are seen to be lined on their inner sides<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214" href="#Page_214"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span></a>
by five or six rows of very minute pores. I have not seen any other
instance of this structure. The internal lamina is ribbed, as usual, on
its inner surface, by the projection of the longitudinal septa. The ordinary
parietal tubes are open, to nearly the summit of the shell. The
<i>radii</i> are rather thin, and unusually fragile; their summits are parallel
to the basis: their septa, as seen on the sutural edges, are extremely
thin and denticulated on both their upper and lower surfaces, on the
side towards the internal lamina: towards the external lamina, the
septa are simple, and the small square pores thus formed, are open or
not filled up. The <i>alæ</i> have their summits extremely oblique, being
added to very little during the diametric growth of the shell; the narrow
margin, however, which is thus added, is coloured red, the rest of
the sheath being nearly colourless: the sutural edges of the alæ are
smooth. The <i>basis</i> has a thick, underlying, finely cancellated layer of
shell.</p>

<p>A young specimen, .2 of an inch in basal diameter, differed from the
above in being of a much paler purplish-brown. This species is distinct
from all its congeners, in its peculiar colour, and likewise in the structure
of the inner lamina of the parietes. As already stated, it comes
nearer to <a href="#Balanus_decorus"><i>B. decorus</i></a> than to any other species.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell globulo-convex, sometimes much elongated
in its rostro-carinal axis; smooth; walls excessively strong,
massive, and heavy. Orifice oval, rather small in proportion to the size
of shell, this being chiefly due to the infolding of the upper part of the
rostral compartment. Parietes pale pink, feebly tinted with purple: radii
either paler, or tinted of a bright chesnut-brown: sheath rich purplish
chesnut-brown. Basal diameter of the largest specimen nearly 3-1/2 of an
inch; height 2-3/4: another specimen had a basal longitudinal diameter of
2.9 of an inch, and a transverse diameter of only 1.6; this great difference
in the two diameters being caused by the prolongation of the
basal portion of the rostrum in the line of the branch of the Millepora,
to which the shell had adhered; the height of this same specimen was<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" href="#Page_215"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span></a>
1.5; and the diameter of the orifice, both transversely and longitudinally,
.75 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, broad, feebly tinted with pink; exterior surface rough, with
sharp hood-formed projections, arranged in straight lines radiating from
the apex; an inflected portion of the valve along the tergal margin is
not roughened. Internally (Pl. <a href="#Page_687">3</a>, fig. <a href="#p03f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>), the articular ridge is
broad and reflexed. An adductor ridge can hardly be said to exist,
but a slight prominence borders the gentle hollow in which the lateral
depressor muscle is attached. The basal margin, on its inner face, is
slightly toothed. <i>Tergum</i> white, with the narrow part of the valve, on
the scutal side of the spur, rough with the little projecting hoods, like
those on the scutum; the other and larger half is smooth: spur rather
long, narrow, placed at twice its own width from the basi-scutal angle;
on the carinal side, about half of the basal margin slopes down towards
the spur. The longitudinal furrow is either quite or nearly closed.
Internally, the spur is produced upwards on the valve, as a prominence:
the articular ridge is not very prominent. There are no crests
for the tergal depressor muscle.</p>

<p>Altogether the opercular valves strikingly resemble those of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>,
but all the characters above mentioned have not been
observed in any one variety of this species; perhaps <i>var. coccopoma</i>
comes nearest, both in the external appearance of the shell and in
the structure of the opercular valves, to <a href="#Balanus_Ajax"><i>B. Ajax</i></a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Compartments</i> are remarkably compact and solid; the parietal
tubes are cylindrical and quite minute even close to the basis; they
extend, however, nearly up to the top of the shell; the parietal septa
at the basis are thick, and with blunt denticuli; the thickness of the
walls in the upper part of the shell is excessive; in the lower part, it
is also unusually great, owing to the thickness of the inner lamina,
and hence the ribs, generally formed by the projection of the longitudinal
septa on the inner lamina, are here visible only close to the
basis. The <i>radii</i> are rather wide; their summits are parallel to the
basis; the septa on their sutural edges are thin, straight, and closely
approximate, and most symmetrically furnished with little denticuli of
equal sizes on both sides: the interspaces are nearly filled up solidly,
but with some pores still left open. In the upper part of the shell,
the radii, like the walls, are of extraordinary thickness: the septa are
transverse and horizontal, as seen externally by slight variations in the
colour of the radii; internally, as seen in a vertical section of the
shell, the septa dip inwards at an angle of above 45°. The <i>alæ</i> are thin,
and have their summits oblique: their sutural edges are smooth. The
pores in the basis are crossed by numerous transverse septa, and there
is an underlying cancellated layer: the internal surface is very smooth.</p>

<p>The strength of this <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> is truly remarkable; and when, by
repeated blows, a specimen which I was examining at last yielded, the
radii broke sooner than separate at their sutures. In most of its

its habit of being attached to Milleporæ. By a close and unbroken

<a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a> and its allies in section (B), which live attached to
Gorgoniæ. Some of the specimens of <a href="#Balanus_Ajax"><i>B. Ajax</i></a>, are almost as much
elongated in their rostro-carinal axis, as are the species in section (B);
and there is an affinity in the same direction in the smallness of the
pores in the radii of <a href="#Balanus_Ajax"><i>B. Ajax</i></a>; indeed, had the basis in this species
been generally more boat-or cup-formed, I should have placed it as
the first species in section (B), instead of, as at present, the last species
in section (A). The intermediateness of the characters of <a href="#Balanus_Ajax"><i>B. Ajax</i></a> has
been one chief cause why I have rejected the genus Conopea, which
was instituted by Say for the species living attached to Gorgoniæ.</p>

closely allied to<a href="#Balanus_Ajax"> <i>B. Ajax</i></a>, especially in its operculum, than to
the following species; yet the fact of the radii not being permeated
by pores does not permit of its admission into the
last section; and both in habits and structure it undoubtedly
comes very near to the following species. Those varieties
which are not much elongated, and which have the basis
nearly flat, would certainly, if considered by themselves
alone, not have gained admission into our present section.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, somewhat globular, more or
less elongated in the rostro-carinal axis, owing to the basal production
of the rostrum. Orifice, rather small, entire, oval, pointed at the
carinal end. Radii moderately broad, with their summits parallel to
the basis. Colour dirty white, often faintly tinged with purple;
sheath, pale purplish-blue. Surface extremely smooth; the parietes
are generally covered (as viewed through a lens) by a very thin, yellowish
epidermis, giving to the whole a glistening, granular aspect:
the radii are generally destitute of this epidermis, and are therefore of a
dead white. The basis is concave, and sometimes deeply cup-formed;
it is, however, not symmetrical; sometimes it is flat. Basal diameter
of largest specimen, including the basis itself, 1.5 of an inch in the
longitudinal axis; transverse diameter, 1 inch; the inequality in the
length of the two diameters is rarely so great as in this unusually large
specimen.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, externally very convex, with the growth-ridges extremely
prominent; basal margin sinuous, the middle portion being prominent;
this is best seen in young specimens (Pl. <a href="#Page_687">3</a>, fig. <a href="#p03f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>). Internally, the
articular ridge is broad and reflexed. The adductor ridge in the upper
part is almost confluent with the articular ridge; it runs down to the most
prominent point of the basal margin; in young specimens it is sharp and
prominent; in old specimens it is very blunt and little prominent. There
is a rather deep hollow for the lateral depressor muscle. In young
specimens there is a small, depending, blunt tooth at the basi-tergal
angle, which helps to make the basal margin more deeply sinuous.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>, with the longitudinal furrow closed, except on the spur itself,
where it is open. The spur is moderately long and broad, but varies
in breadth; it is placed at rather less than its own width from the
basi-scutal angle; its lower end is obliquely rounded; the basal margin
on the opposite sides of the spur, together form a nearly straight line.
The whole valve is rather broad. The crests for the tergal depressores
are barely developed.</p>

<p>The <i>Compartments</i> have rather large parietal tubes; the septa are
coarsely denticulated at their bases; the internal lamina is smooth, except
close to the basis. The <i>radii</i> have their summits parallel to the basis;
their sutural edges are formed of rather thick septa, which stand at an
unusual distance apart from each other, and have perfectly symmetrical,
minute denticuli on each side. The interspaces between the septa are
filled up solidly to within a short distance of the surface; but yet not so<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" href="#Page_218"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</span></a>
completely as in the following species, and as in those in the succeeding
sections of the genus; this is what might have been expected
from the close affinity of <a href="#Balanus_stultus"><i>B. stultus</i></a> to <a href="#Balanus_Ajax"><i>B. Ajax</i></a>, in which latter the
radii are still permeated by pores, though smaller than is general in the
species of our first section (A). The <i>alæ</i> have their summits extremely
oblique, and their sutural edges, I believe, smooth. <i>Basis</i> porose,
with an underlying, finely-cancellated layer.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with six small teeth; mandibles with the 3d tooth
blunt; the 4th minute, and the 5th almost confluent with the inferior
angle. Maxillæ with the edge straight and simple. <i>Cirri</i> partly destroyed;
on each segment of the sixth pair there were five pairs of spines.</p>

<p class="p2">I must premise, with respect to the nomenclature of this
and the three following quite distinct species, that in the
published descriptions no allusion is made to any one of
the characters by which alone they can be distinguished:
hence I have been guided by geographical probabilities in
assigning the specific name of <i>calceolus</i> to the present
species, as Ellis's specimens came from the Mediterranean;
and that of <a href="#Balanus_galeatus"><i>galeatus</i></a> to the North American and West
Indian specimens, as Linnæus' original specimens (according
to a statement by Spengler) came from the West
Indies. I have assigned new names to the two remaining
East Indian species. I may here add that Spengler
('Skrifter af Naturhist.' 1 B, tab. 6, fig. 3, 1790) has
described, under the name of <i>B. cassis</i>, an allied form
attached to the <i>Gorgonia placomus</i> from the seas of<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" href="#Page_219"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span></a>
Norway; but I do not believe that it is the same with our
present species.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—The degree of elongation of the shell in its
rostro-carinal axis varies considerably (<a href="#p03f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p03f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>): the elongation is due
to the production of the rostrum and of the corresponding end of the
basal cup. These two portions of the shell always form together an
angle, and sometimes an acute angle, whereas in all the many specimens
which I have seen, the carina and the carinal end (or heel) of the basis
together form a straight line; yet I should not be surprised if this end
of the shell was sometimes produced. The surface of the shell is
smooth, or sometimes marked with very minute projecting points: it is
almost always covered by the horny bark of the Gorgonia. The colour
is either dull purplish-red or dull purple, with obscure longitudinal
stripes, and often more or less transversely banded with white. The
rostrum is either white or very feebly tinted, being always paler than
the rest of the shell: the radii are usually paler than the parietes, and
are sometimes white: the carinal end of the basal cup is tinted of the
same colour with, but rather paler than, the compartments. The orifice
is rather small compared to the shell, and nearly heart-shaped. The
carino-lateral compartments are about one-third of the width of the
lateral compartments. The shell is very strong, and the sutures resist
the action of boiling caustic potash. The largest specimen which I
have seen was .7 of an inch in extreme length, and under .25 in extreme
breadth.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the shell and basis.</i>—The parietes are permeated by
quite distinct pores,—a character sufficient by itself to separate this
from the following species; the longitudinal septa forming the tubes
are slightly denticulated at their bases. The radii have their summits
quite square, extending from apex to apex of the adjoining compartments.
The alæ have oblique summits. The sutural edges of the
radii have approximate septa, which are obscurely denticulated: the
interspaces are filled up solidly, so that the radii are not porose. The
basis is distinctly porose, by which this species can be distinguished
from <a href="#Balanus_navicula"><i>B. navicula</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_cymbiformis"><i>cymbiformis</i></a>. The basis has a deep furrow on
the under side, from clasping the thin horny axis of the Gorgonia: the
basal point of the rostrum is also notched from the same cause, and,
as a consequence, its upper surface becomes slightly furrowed along its
whole length.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> have an articular ridge but moderately prominent, and
only slightly reflexed; the basi-tergal corner is rounded off; there is
no adductor ridge; there is a small, rather deep, distinct pit for the
lateral depressor muscle. <i>Terga</i>; externally the surface is considerably
depressed in the line of the spur. The spur is between half and one-third
of the width of the valve: its lower end is square and truncated,
or in some degree rounded; it is sometimes (<a href="#p03f03e">3 <i>e</i></a>) dentated with a few,
minute, sharp teeth. The articular ridge is but slightly developed;
the crests for the depressor muscle are very feeble.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—This and the two following species come so
close in general appearance to the last, that it will be quite superfluous
to do more than describe the few points of difference. The shell and
basis are generally quite as much elongated as in the last species, and
sometimes much more so, owing to the carinal end (fig. <a href="#p03f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>), with the
corresponding portion of the basal cup, being produced like the rostral
end, into a flattened, sharp point: I have seen a specimen in this state
.9 of an inch in length, and only .25 in breadth in the broadest part.
In many specimens, however, the shape is exactly as in <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a>;
but the rostrum seems less usually furrowed from clasping the stem of
the Gorgonia. The colour is paler, pinker, and more distinctly striped
longitudinally than in <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a>; I have, however, seen some not-striped,
purple specimens (and one transversely freckled with white)
from the West Indies. The parietes are strongly-ribbed internally, and
are not permeated by pores. The radii have their sutural edges crenated.
The basal cup is permeated by pores.</p>

<p>The <i>Scutum</i> differs from that in the last species, only in the pit for
the lateral depressor muscle, being much shallower, and less defined,
and in the apex being truncated. The <i>Tergum</i> is remarkable from its
broad, square, truncated summit, which underlies the whole broad apex
of the scutum: the square summit of the tergum is formed by a great
and peculiar development of the uppermost part of the articular ridge.
The spur is a little narrower than in <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: on the crest of the labrum there are two teeth on each side
of the central notch. The mandibles have five teeth, of which the two
lower are very small. The maxillæ show a trace of a notch under the
upper large pair of spines; near the inferior angle there are two long
spines. <i>Cirri</i>: in the first pair, one ramus is nearly twice as long as
the other: the segments are not very protuberant. There is a sharp
point at the dorsal basis of the penis. The branchiæ are of moderate
size, and plicated on one side.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—I have seen only two specimens, kindly sent
me by Dr. Johnston, and a single specimen in Mr. Cuming's collection.
In most points this species agrees with the two last species. The shell
(excepting the rostrum), and even the opercular valves in Mr. Cuming's
specimen were of a very fine purplish-red; in the other specimens
they were feebly tinted purple. The parietes are strongly ribbed internally,
and are not permeated by pores. The basal cup is not porose,
but its inner surface is ribbed in lines radiating from the centre, and in
both these respects this species differs from the two foregoing. The
Radii are rather narrow; they are paler coloured than the parietes;
they have their sutural edges plainly crenated. The alæ have extremely
oblique summits; the narrow rim added during the diametric
growth of the shell is white, the rest of the sheath being, in Mr. Cuming's
specimen, finely coloured like the parietes. Basal diameter of the
longer axis of the largest specimen, .4 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i>, rather narrow, with the basi-tergal corner much rounded
off; externally the lines of growth are little prominent. Internally,
the articular ridge is extremely little developed, and not at all reflexed;
there is no adductor ridge; there is a minute pit for the lateral depressor
muscle, placed almost on the edge of the valve. The <i>Tergum</i>
is broad, forming (the spur being excepted) an almost equilateral triangle.
The articular ridge is remarkably little prominent, and placed
close to the scutal margin. The spur is nearly half as broad as the
valve, with its extremity or basal margin in one case obliquely truncated,
and in another case nearly square.</p>

<p class="p2">This is a very distinct form, though nearer to the
foregoing than to the other species. Its separation from
the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> is quite artificial; its affinity to this
sub-genus is shown by its weaker shell, non-porose parietes
and basis; by the radii having their sutural edges smooth,
and their summits not quite square; by the carino-lateral
compartments being very narrow; by the less elongated
basis, not furrowed, from not clasping the branches of the
Gorgonia; and by the longitudinally striated scuta; nevertheless,
from the similar habits, and from the graduated
structure in the five foregoing species, it cannot be removed
out of the genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. I have seen three sets of specimens
of this species.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell, sometimes with the rostrum, and sometimes
with the carina, and corresponding portions of the basal cup,
elongated; but not, apparently, to so great a degree as in the foregoing
species; basis not furrowed, from not clasping the branches of the
Gorgonia. Colour pale blueish-purple, with the radii whiter. The
surface is studded with small calcareous points. The carino-lateral
compartments are very narrow, not more than one tenth of the width
of the lateral compartments; they are, moreover, scarcely wider at the
base than at the summit. The summits of the radii are, apparently, a
little oblique, or at least not so square as in the foregoing species.
The shell is not nearly so strong as in the last three species; and the
compartments separate by gentle force, and from the action of caustic
potash. The largest specimen was .4 of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p>Internally, the parietes are not very strongly ribbed, or they are
almost smooth, and there are no pores. The basis is concave and
smooth within, and is not porose. The sutural edges of the radii are
quite smooth, or sometimes they exhibit, in the lower part, mere traces
of septa,—a character by itself sufficient to separate this from the
foregoing species. The alæ have oblique summits, and the rather narrow
portion added during the diametric growth of the shell, is white.</p>

<p>The <i>Scutum</i>, externally (<a href="#p03f06d">6 <i>d</i></a>), has raised striæ, radiating from the
apex; valve rather thick; internally, the articular ridge is but slightly
prominent, and its lower end is rounded off: the depression for the
lateral depressor muscle is slight; between this depression and that
for the adductor muscle, the surface of the valve is prominent.
<i>Tergum</i>, somewhat beaked; externally, the surface is depressed in the
line of the spur: the carino-basal margin slopes towards the spur.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, generally depressed; orifice
broad, triangular, almost equilateral; walls coloured or only mottled
with purplish-pink, having either irregularly branching, or regular,
longitudinal ribs, which are generally white. The radii are pale pink,
or nearly white: the opercular valves have either their upper parts, or
nearly their whole surface, clouded with pinkish-purple: the epidermis
is not persistent: the walls are moderately strong: the largest specimen
was one inch, but generally full-grown specimens are about half
an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> have the lines of growth highly prominent. From one
to five or six rows (<a href="#p03f07b">7 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p03f07c">7 <i>c</i></a>) of nearly circular, or transversely oblong,
deep pits, extend down the middle of the valve; rarely there is not
even one row; in this latter case, the valve is not striated longitudinally.
These little pits are caused by one or more deep longitudinal
furrows, crossed by the lines, or rather ridges, of growth.
In the same group of specimens, I have seen individuals with three,
five, and six rows; and even a few specimens with only one row, or
none at all. The outline of the valve is elongated, with the apex
slightly reflexed: the inner surface is protuberant, sometimes to a
remarkable, but variable degree. The articular ridge is not very prominent,
but it extends fully half-way down the valve, and generally
ends in a small free point. There is a short adductor ridge, and a
deep narrow pit or cleft for the lateral-depressor muscle. <i>Terga</i>, externally
smooth, flat, with scarcely a trace of a longitudinal furrow;
spur broad (<a href="#p03f07e">7 <i>e</i></a>, <a href="#p03f07f">7 <i>f</i></a>), varying from half to one third of the width of<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" href="#Page_224"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span></a>
the valve, with the end truncated, situated either near or quite close to
the basi-scutal angle. The crests for the depressor muscles are moderately
well developed.</p>

<p><i>Compartments.</i>—The parietal tubes are, in their upper parts, filled
up solidly, without transverse septa. The radii generally have their
summits slightly oblique, and this is almost always the case with
the radii of the rostrum; the other radii sometimes extend from tip to
tip of the parietes, and are parallel to the basis; rarely the radii are considerably
oblique. The septa of the radii are very obscurely denticulated,
and the interspaces between them are filled up solidly. The
alæ have their sutural edges thin and smooth.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—Labrum with three teeth close together on each side of the
central notch: mandibles with four teeth, the fourth being small, the
fifth either absent or scarcely distinguishable from the inferior angle:
maxillæ without any notch, with the two lower spines rather longer
than the others. <i>Cirri</i>: In the first pair, one ramus is only half the
length of the other; in the second pair, both rami are short and about
equal in length; in the posterior pairs, the segments, which are not
protuberant, bear four pairs of spines, of which the three lower pairs
are short.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">This species is widely-distributed, and where found seems
to be common. It is generally attached to shells of mollusca,
but I have seen it also attached to wood. I have
found it associated with <i><a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum">B. tintinnabulum</a>, var. concinnus</i>,
and <i>coccopoma</i>, with <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>,
and with <a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>Elminius modestus</i></a>.</p>

<p>Young specimens bear a considerable resemblance to
certain young varieties of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, and can indeed
be distinguished from them only by a careful examination
of the opercular valves; for it should be borne in mind,
that in certain cases the scuta in <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a> are
pitted with little cavities. This species in some respects is,
I think, allied to <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a>, but it is far more closely
related to <i><a href="#Balanus_spongicola">B. spongicola</a></i>, and can be discriminated with
difficulty from certain varieties of this latter species. In
Mr. Cuming's collection, there is a group of small specimens,
crowded between some older specimens, which are remarkable
from the shell being oval in a transverse section,—from
the smoothness of the walls,—and from the absence
of pits on the scuta; yet there could be no doubt that these
specimens belonged to our present species.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Description.</i>—Shell tubulo-conical; orifice of moderate size,
rather deeply toothed; colour dull pink, or purplish, or dark flesh-colour;
sometimes the radii are paler, sometimes of the same colour
with the parietes. Surface smooth when well preserved, having transverse
rows of minute spines. In the West Indian variety the walls are
slightly or much folded, but I will describe this form separately. Size
of largest specimen (Mus. Jeffreys), .6 of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i>, with fine ridges radiating from the apex, and with the lines
of growth, crenated: internally, the articular ridge is small, adductor
ridge short and barely distinct: there is a rather deep and narrow pit
for the lateral depressor muscle. The whole valve is much thinner than
in <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B. trigonus</i></a>, which in most respects it closely resembles. <i>Tergum</i>,
with the apex pinkish purple, produced or beaked, but the beak is not
needle-like, as in <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> and its allies, for the carinal margin is
perfectly preserved up to the tip. Externally the valve is nearly flat,
for the longitudinal furrow is very shallow. The spur is about one
third of the width of the valve; its lower end is abruptly truncated: in
European specimens (<a href="#p04f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>) the whole basal margin, on the carinal side,
slopes down to the spur in a straight line, which, together with the
sharpness and production of the basi-scutal angle of the spur itself,
gives to the whole valve a peculiar appearance: in the specimen (<a href="#p04f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>)
from the Lagulhas Bank, the basal margin on the carinal side is a little
more hollowed out, but it is quite impossible to doubt about the specific
identity of these specimens: in the West Indian variety (<a href="#p04f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>) the basal<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" href="#Page_226"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span></a>
margin on the carinal side forms a distinct but obtuse angle with the
spur. In all cases the crests for the depressor muscles are very feebly
developed.</p>

<p>The <i>Compartments</i> have their radii developed to a rather varying
degree, with their summits oblique; hence the orifice is toothed: the
sutural edges of the radii have their septa barely denticulated; the
sutural edges of the alæ are smooth. The basis, as with the other
species of this section, is permeated by pores; yet I found one specimen,
from the Cape of Good Hope, with the basis apparently solid,
thus offering a very singular anomaly. In the specimen imbedded in
sponge, the basis, as viewed externally, is concave; whereas in <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>,
which always inhabits sponges, the basis is highly convex or hemispherical.</p>

<p>The <i>Mouth</i> and <i>Cirri</i> resemble those of <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B. trigonus</i></a>, and I can point
out no distinguishing character.</p>

<p>With respect to the variety from the West Indies, I have seen two
sets of specimens differing somewhat in external appearance, one set
attached to a coral from St. Vincent's, and another set to an Avicula
from an unknown locality; at first I described these specimens, with
some hesitation, as a distinct species, and I am very far from sure
whether this would not have been the more correct course, although I
am unable to point out any sufficient diagnostic characters. This form
differs from the ordinary <a href="#Balanus_spongicola"><i>B. spongicola</i></a>, in the walls being more rugged,
stronger, and slightly or deeply folded longitudinally; in this latter
case the shell in external aspect differs much from ordinary specimens
of <a href="#Balanus_spongicola"><i>B. spongicola</i></a>; but this is a variation so common that I dare not
place any reliance on it. The colour is more purple; the summits of
the radii perhaps rather less oblique. In the scuta the only difference
is that the articular ridge seems rather longer, and the adductor ridge
perhaps more prominent: in the terga, as already remarked, the basal
margin on the carinal side does not slope so straight into the spur.
These differences I consider all too slight to be of specific value. The
difficulty in determining the nature of this variety is added to by its
approach to <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B. trigonus</i></a> in all those points in which it departs from the
ordinary <a href="#Balanus_spongicola"><i>B. spongicola</i></a>, so that for a short time I was even tempted
to consider both these species as varieties of one form. But until
<a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B. trigonus</i></a> is found with its scutum longitudinally striated, and with
its tergum beaked, it can hardly be confounded with <a href="#Balanus_spongicola"><i>B. spongicola</i></a>;
for it should be observed that when in <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B. trigonus</i></a> the rows of little
pits disappear from the scuta, as sometimes happens, though rarely,
yet these valves do not become longitudinally striated.</p>

<p><a href="#Balanus_spongicola"><i>Balanus spongicola</i></a> occurs, mingled with <a href="#Balanus_tulipiformis"><i>B. tulipiformis</i></a>, in the
Mediterranean, and by the external characters of the shell alone cannot
be distinguished from that species; but the striated scuta and beaked
terga suffice to separate them. Again, this species, at the Cape of
Good Hope, occurs mingled with <a href="#Balanus_Capensis"><i>B. Capensis</i></a>, and from the non-striped
young varieties of that species, it can, externally, be distinguished only
by the beak of the tergum not being sharp like a needle. I have seen
a single, perfectly characterised specimen, with its opercular valves
preserved, found by Mr. S. Wood in the Coralline Crag at Sutton,
mingled with <a href="#Balanus_inclusus"><i>B. inclusus</i></a>.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">I may premise that, having myself collected this species
from the same locality, the Strait of Magellan, where no
allied species occurs, attached to the same Mytilus and
associated with the same <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>, I feel confident that it is
the <i>B. lævis</i> described by Bruguière; and there can hardly
be any doubt that it is the <i>B. discors</i> of Ranzani. With
respect to the old tertiary specimens from Coquimbo,
named <i>B. Coquimbensis</i> by Sowerby, they differ from the
recent in no respect, except in being considerably larger;
and therefore I cannot consider them specifically distinct.
At first I was unwilling to believe that the specimens with<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228" href="#Page_228"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span></a>
a single very broad longitudinal furrow, and those with
two rather broad, or with one narrow furrow, on their
scuta, could belong to the same species; but I soon
found that all these varieties occurred mingled together,
and that they differed in no other respect whatever.
Generally, however, all the individuals in the same cluster
had the same variety of scutum,—thus adding one more to
the many instances amongst cirripedes of variations common
to whole groups of specimens. Still more unwilling
was I to believe that <i>var. nitidus</i> and the common
variety could belong to the same species. Their general
aspect is totally unlike: <i>var. nitidus</i> has a smooth, clean,
naked shell, either white or pale purple, somewhat globulo-conical,
often with a nearly entire orifice; whereas the other
common variety generally has a more steeply conical shell,
with a toothed orifice, and is covered by a dirty brownish
membrane. Moreover, though I have seen hundreds of
specimens from Tierra del Fuego, I have not seen one
specimen of <i>var. nitidus</i>, or even of an approach to it in
appearance; and, on the other hand, <i>var. nitidus</i> is the
common form in Chile and Peru; though I have seen one
or two specimens of the membrane-covered variety from
Valparaiso. Such facts strongly induced me to believe
that these forms were specifically distinct; but upon careful
examination I could find no other or more important
differences than those just specified. Some specimens
from northern Chile are in an intermediate condition;
and from Concepcion, in the south of Chile, where the
climate approaches in character to that of the more southern
parts of the Continent, there are many specimens, in so
intermediate a condition that I know not whether or no to
rank them under <i>var. nitidus</i>. Thus I became convinced
that these forms are only varieties. At Concepcion, some
few specimens are pale purple, and yet are wholly invested
by thick brown membrane, thus uniting the two extreme
varieties. From California I have seen both varieties, but
I do not know which is most common there. With respect
to the great difference in aspect between the specimens
from northern Chile and Tierra del Fuego, we shall hereafter
see a strictly analogous case in <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>Balanus flosculus</i></a>.<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229" href="#Page_229"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span></a>
Finally, I may add that <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a> seems to represent in the
southern hemisphere and on the west coast of North
America, the <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a> of Europe and Western Africa.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, sometimes slightly globular;
surface smooth (that is, not folded), either naked, and in that case
white or pale purple, or covered by dirty yellowish-brown membrane.
Orifice small, more or less toothed, rarely exceeding one third of the
basal diameter. Radii very narrow, often not developed, the six sutures
forming in all cases deep and narrow clefts. The largest recent, but
much depressed, specimen which I have seen (from the Strait of
Magellan) was three fourths of an inch in basal diameter; specimens
growing congregated are often much elongated. I have seen one with
the basal cup between two and three times as deep as the height of the
compartments. Of the ancient tertiary specimens, the largest had a
diameter of three fourths of an inch, and a total length of actually two
inches (fig. <a href="#p04f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>); another of these fossils had a basal cup in depth
equalling four fifths of the entire length of the shell and basis.</p>

<p>The <i>scutum</i> has either one very broad and deep longitudinal furrow
(<a href="#p04f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>), or two moderately broad and deep (<a href="#p04f02e">2 <i>e</i></a>), or two narrow and
deep, or less frequently one narrow and inconspicuous longitudinal
furrow (<a href="#p04f02f">2 <i>f</i></a>); rarely there is not one furrow; sometimes there are
none towards the apex, whilst furrows have been formed in the lower
part of the valve. In young specimens the furrows extend down to
the actual basal margin, but in old specimens they often fall short of
this, and, as a consequence, the furrows become crossed by one, two,
or three calcareous ridges, which ridges at successive periods formed
the basal margin of the valve. The external surface is covered by
yellow membrane; and fragments of several successive opercular membranes
are often attached to the zones of growth.</p>

<p>Internally the articular ridge is not very prominent, but is remarkable
(<a href="#p04f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p04f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>) from its lower point being produced into a long, sharp,
sub-cylindrical, free style (like the hinge of a common gate), which is
generally broken off in disarticulating the valve from the tergum. The
adductor ridge is either sharp and prominent or blunt: it extends up
the middle of the valve nearly to the apex, and downwards it trends a
little towards the occludent margin. The pit for the lateral depressor
muscle is minute but deep: the basal margin is sometimes hollowed
out under this pit. Sometimes there is a distinct, but blunt ridge,
caused by one of the furrows outside, parallel to the adductor ridge,
and placed between it and the little pit for the lateral depressor; in
this case, the basal margin, as viewed internally, is rendered sinuous
(<a href="#p04f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>), as is best exhibited in the great fossil specimens from Coquimbo.</p>

<p><i>Tergum</i> (<a href="#p04f02g">2 <i>g</i></a>).—Spur of moderate length and breadth, with its lower
end obliquely truncated and rounded. The longitudinal furrow has its
edges somewhat folded in. The basal margin on the carinal side of
the spur is sometimes a little hollowed out. The crests for the depressor
muscles are well developed; but the corner of the valve supporting
them is extremely thin, and is often imperfectly calcified.</p>

<p><i>Compartments.</i>—The parietal tubes are not crossed by transverse<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" href="#Page_230"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span></a>
septa, but in their upper parts are filled up solidly. The radii are
always very narrow, with their summits oblique, though to a variable
degree: their sutural edges have fine and closely approximate septa,
with minute denticuli: the sutural edges are received in a furrow, on
the opposed compartment, of unusual depth; hence the lines of suture
run, in the lower part of the shell, almost exactly in the middle between
each two compartments. The alæ are added to above the level of the
opercular membrane.</p>

<p>The <i>Basis</i> is often thick, with an underlying layer, largely cancellated
or honeycombed. When many specimens grow crowded together,
the basis is generally deeply cup-formed, or even sub-cylindrical; and
equals as much as four fifths of the length of the entire shell. In such
cases, in some few recent specimens, and in all the large or even
quarter-grown old tertiary specimens, but not in the quite young fossil
specimens, a structure is presented, which I have not seen in any other
Cirripede, namely, the basis (Pl. <a href="#Page_688">4</a>, fig. <a href="#p04f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>) is filled up for one
third, or even for more than half its depth, by successive, separate,
calcareous, transverse layers or septa. It would appear as if the basal
cup had grown too large for the animal's body, and so required filling
up. The layers are thin and fragile; a single layer never stretches
across the whole shell; each is irregularly mammillated or blistered,
with the convex surfaces generally directed upwards; the layers are
furnished on their under sides with little pillars and short ridges,
resting on the layers beneath; it rarely happens that the supports of
one layer lie directly over those of another, though this is sometimes
the case. In a vertical section, the mass formed by these irregular
layers has a coarsely cancellated structure. This structure, although
confined to this one Cirripede, is not so anomalous as might at first be
thought, for in most species of the genus, each time that the circumference
of the basis is added to, an excessively thin calcified film is
thrown down over its whole inner surface; and in any of these species,
if the films had been formed thicker and had rested only on certain
points, instead of over the whole underlying layer, the cancellated
structure above described would have been produced.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: the labrum is either destitute of teeth, or has two or three
very minute teeth. The palpi have a tuft of very long spines at their
ends. The third tooth of the mandibles is thicker and larger than the
two upper ones. The maxillæ have either a nearly straight edge, or
the inferior corner is obliquely truncated, and projects much beyond
the rest of the edge. In the <i>Cirri</i>, none of the segments are very protuberant:
in the first pair, one ramus is nearly twice as long as the
other: in the posterior pairs, the segments are not much elongated,
but each supports seven pairs of spines.</p>

<p><i>Var. nitidus</i>: with respect to this variety I have little to add to my
preliminary remarks on its peculiar appearance, owing to its smooth,
naked condition, and pure white or pale purple colour. This colour,
when examined through a lens, is seen to consist of very fine longitudinal
stripes; and is produced by the calcareous matter within the
longitudinal parietal pores being thus coloured. Generally the scuta
have two longitudinal furrows; but I have seen a scutum of one perfectly
characterised specimen with only a single broad furrow, like that<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231" href="#Page_231"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span></a>
which frequently occurs in the membrane-covered variety. <i>Var.
Coquimbensis</i>, as before stated, differs only in its greater size: the
scutum, in the one specimen examined, had two broad longitudinal
furrows; neither it, nor the tergum differed from certain varieties now
found on the coast of Chile.</p>

ridges, the smallness of the orifice, the longitudinal furrow on the terga, the
colour, size, and habitat, all given by Pulteney or Montagu, will agree with no
other British species. The <i>Lepas balanus</i> of Poli, which is certainly a synonym
of our present species, has been erroneously considered by several authors to
be the same with the <i>L. balanoides</i> of Poli, which latter undoubtedly is the

</div>


<p class="p2">This is a well-marked species, and in its essential characters
does not vary much; but owing to the shell being
almost as often white as purple,—to its being remarkably
subject to disintegration,—to its often becoming cylindrical,—to
the radii being either not at all, or slightly, or moderately,
or largely developed, and consequently to the orifice
of the shell varying in size, the general external appearance
of the different varieties is singularly diversified; but when a
series of specimens is examined, it is easy to see how one
form passes into another.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, with the orifice oval, unusually
small, being generally only from one third to half of the basal diameter;
sometimes moderately large; in one single instance as wide as
the basis. Radii, often represented by mere lineal fissures, or they are
narrow, or sometimes moderately wide. Colour pale, dull purple,
sometimes lilac, often passing into a dead pure white: the same individual
will occasionally have one part of its shell white, and another
purple: the purple tint almost invariably is nearly uniform, or not in
stripes. The radii are generally white, when the whole shell is purple,
but sometimes they are pale purple: the sheath is apparently always
coloured of a fine claret-purple, with the triangular portion of the alæ,
added during diametric growth, generally white, but sometimes purple.
The surface is quite smooth, but very often, especially on the shores of
England, whole groups of specimens (excepting the very young ones,)
have had the outer lamina of the parietes entirely corroded and
removed; in this case the shell assumes a dirty, more or less dark,
ash-colour, feebly tinted with purple, and the whole surface, owing to
the exposure of the solidly filled-up parietal tubes, becomes finely
striated, or covered with very narrow, longitudinal ridges. When
specimens are crowded together they often become cylindrical, and<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233" href="#Page_233"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]</span></a>
much elongated, owing to the basis becoming deeply cup-formed: I
have seen specimens, half an inch in diameter in the widest part, one
inch and a half in height, the walls forming only a third of this. The
largest specimen which I have seen (from the southern shores of
England) had a basal diameter of 1.2 of an inch; some very steeply
conical specimens were .9 of an inch in height, and .8 in basal
diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, externally, slightly convex; growth-ridges approximate, moderately
prominent. Internally (Pl. <a href="#Page_688">4</a>, fig. <a href="#p04f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>) the articular ridge is
moderately developed, with the lower end produced downwards into a
freely depending, flattened style, somewhat variable in size, but not so
long as in <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a>, and easily broken in disarticulating the valves.
The adductor ridge is very prominent, running from almost the apex
of the valve, close to the articular ridge, to near the basal margin.
The basi-tergal portion of the valve is converted by the adductor ridge
into a rather deep cavity, within which there is a short, sharp, and
minute ridge, close and parallel to the adductor ridge, and bounding the
impression left by the lateral depressor muscle: this insignificant ridge
was present in every specimen; it occurs only in very few other species,
as in <a href="#Balanus_nubilus"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: B. nubibus"><i>B. nubilus</i></span></a> and <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>cariosus</i></a>. The thickness of the valve sometimes
varies a little, and when thick the adductor ridge does not appear quite
so prominent. <i>Tergum</i>, with the apex moderately beaked and produced;
beak triangular in section, coloured dark purple, as is the upper
internal surface of the valve; the longitudinal furrow is deep, and has
its edges folded in, and even quite closed. The spur is moderately long
and narrow; but its width varies a little (Pl. <a href="#Page_688">4</a>, fig. <a href="#p04f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p04f03c">3 <i>c</i></a>), and consequently
it stands at either rather above or at twice its own breadth
from the basi-scutal angle: its lower end is either bluntly pointed or
square, and generally is feebly toothed on the under-side. The basal
margin of the valve generally slopes a little, on both sides, towards the
spur. Internally, the scutal margin is but slightly inflected: the
articular ridge is but slightly prominent, and but little curved; in the
upper part of the valve there are generally several very minute ridges,
parallel to the articular ridge, on the side towards the scutum. The
internal surface of the spur itself is sometimes concave. The crests
for the carinal depressor muscle are barely developed. It may here be
mentioned that on the opercular membrane many long spines stand
rudely arranged in rows.</p>

<p><i>Parietes</i>: the parietal tubes have not transverse septa; but are
solidly filled up in their upper parts by dark-purple layers of shell.
The <i>radii</i>, as already stated, are either not at all developed, or are
extremely or only moderately narrow, with their summits more or less
oblique: in Mr. Cuming's collection, however, there is an unique
specimen, <i>var. mirabilis</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_689">5</a>, fig. <a href="#p05f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>) with the aperture of the shell
as wide as the basis, with bright purple parietes, and white, very broad
radii, having their summits parallel to the basis. The septa of the
radii are finely denticulated, and the interspaces are filled up solidly.
The <i>alæ</i> have very oblique summits, and their edges are finely crenated.
<i>Basis</i>, flat, or deeply cup-shaped; there is often an underlying,
coarsely-cancellated layer.</p>

<p><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234" href="#Page_234"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum finely hairy, but without any teeth; mandibles,
with the 4th tooth small; the 5th confluent, with the sometimes
smooth, sometimes pectinated inferior angle. Maxillæ, rather broad,
with a slight notch under the upper pair of spines. <i>Cirri</i>, first pair,
with one ramus, having 29 segments, and above one third longer than
the shorter ramus, having 17 segments; these latter segments are
remarkable by the extent to which their upper front surfaces are
laterally produced into projections, twice as long as the breadth of that
portion of the segment which is articulated to the adjoining segment.
These projections have a double row of serrated spines on their upper
edge, and a beautiful radiating bundle at the end; the projections decrease
in length, both in the upper and lower segments. The second
cirrus (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f04">4</a>) has the segments (13 in number, in the same
individual with the segments above enumerated) of both rami
produced in the same singular manner as in the first pair. The third
pair have only inverted conical segments, coloured darker purple than
the other cirri. The sixth pair had in the same individual 31 or 32
segments, and therefore one or two more than in the longer ramus of
the first pair.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[93]</span></a> The segments in the posterior cirri have their anterior
faces shield-shaped, and bear 6 or 7 pairs of spines, with some minute
intermediate spines. There is the usual point at the dorsal basis of the
penis.</p>

the cirri of this species at successive ages.</p></div>

<p><i>Range.</i>—This species is common on the southern shores of England
and in the Channel Islands: the largest specimens which I have seen
came from these quarters. The most northern point whence I have
seen specimens, is Tenby, in South Wales. This species is common
throughout the Mediterranean; I have seen specimens from Malaga,
Sicily, Algiers, and Smyrna; thence it ranges down the western coast
of Africa, as far south as the Gambia and Loanda, in 9° south latitude.
I believe British specimens are more often corroded than those from
further south. Amongst some old, ill-kept specimens in a box in the
British Museum, marked "Kingston, Jamaica," there were some of
this species: also I received some specimens, marked "S. America,"
from Mr. G. B. Sowerby: again, Ellis, in Phil. Trans., vol. 50, part
11, gives a figure (Tab. 34, fig. 15) of some specimens from the West
Indies, which I believe to be <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a>: hence, it is in some degree
probable that this species, like <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>,
and <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a>, may be found on both sides of the equatorial Atlantic.
<a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Balanus perforatus</i></a> is attached, together with <a href="#Balanus_tulipiformis"><i>B. tulipiformis</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>trigonus</i></a>,
<a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>, <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>, and <i>Pollicipes cornucopia</i>, usually to
rocks, near the lower limit of the tidal level; but I believe, from
specimens kindly sent me by Mr. Mac Andrew, that it is frequently
obtained by dredging; one specimen was even marked 30 fathoms.
According to Poli, it is sometimes attached to the bottoms of vessels;
and I have seen a specimen adhering to the floating <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Lepas Hilii"><i>Lepas Hillii</i></span>.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This is a distinct species, closely allied to no other
species, but comes nearest to <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a>, which is its representative in<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235" href="#Page_235"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span></a>
Southern America, and on the whole west coast of that continent. It
is allied to that species, and differs from most other species, in the
general form of the shell, its small orifice, narrow radii, and often
deeply cup-formed basis. It agrees to a certain extent in the colouring,
though the purple here is much more prevalent, and is not confined to the
shelly matter filling up the parietal tubes. It agrees with that species in
the general structure of the scutum; but the two or three deep, longitudinal
furrows are here absent; and the minute ridge, parallel to and
almost under the adductor ridge, is a peculiarity confined to this and
very few species in the genus. The terga differ from those of <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a>,
chiefly in the spur being narrower, and in the apex being beaked.
Lastly, the highly protuberant segments of the one ramus in the first
cirrus, and of both rami in the second pair, are here remarkable. With
regard to the varieties, I have nothing to add to their short diagnostic
characters above given.</p>

imbedded, together with seventeen species of recent shells and with human
remains, at the height of eighty-five feet.</p></div>


<p class="p2">This species has caused me much trouble. Looking first
to the recent specimens, I examined several from Panama<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236" href="#Page_236"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span></a>
and California, which, though differing greatly in colour,
resembled each other in their scuta having the adductor
ridge extremely prominent, and in having (Pl. <a href="#Page_688">4</a>, fig. <a href="#p04f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>),
an almost tubular cavity for the attachment of the lateral
depressor muscle,—characters which at first appeared of
high specific value; but I soon found other specimens from
Panama in which these peculiarities were barely developed.
I then examined a single specimen from the Philippine
Archipelago, resembling in external appearance one of the
Panama varieties, but differing in the scuta being externally
strongly denticulated in lines instead of being merely striated,—in
the adductor ridge being far less prominent,—and
in the spur of the tergum being broader and more truncated;
I therefore considered this as a distinct species. I then
examined a single white rugged specimen from the coast of
Peru, which differed from the Philippine specimen in the
shape of the well-defined denticulations on the scuta, and in
some other trifling respects, and in the segments of the
posterior cirri bearing a greater number of spines; with considerable
doubt, I also named this as distinct. But when I
came to examine a large series of fossil specimens from the
Coralline Crag of England, from northern Italy, from Portugal,
and from the southern United States, I at once discovered
that the form of the denticuli on the scuta was a
quite worthless character,—that in young specimens the
scuta were only striated,—that the prominence of the adductor
scutorum ridge and the depth of the cavity for the
lateral depressor muscle varied much (as in the case of the
recent specimens), owing apparently to the varying thickness
of the valve,—that in the terga the spur varied considerably
in length and breadth, the latter character being
in part determined by the varying extent to which the
edges of the longitudinal furrow are folded in,—and lastly,
that in young specimens the basal end of the spur is much
more abruptly truncated than in the old. Hence I have
been compelled to throw all these forms, originally considered
by me as specifically distinct, into one species. I must
repeat that this considerable variation in the prominence of
the adductor ridge, and in the depth of the pit for the
lateral depressor muscle—the pit in some cases becoming
even tubular—is a very unusual circumstance.</p>

<p><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" href="#Page_237"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span></a></p>

<p>With respect to the fossil specimens<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[96]</span></a> from the above-stated
several distant localities, I consider them as certainly
belonging to one species, though varying considerably
in several points of structure. When compared
with the recent specimens, they differ from them in often
attaining a considerably larger size; in the parietes being
often, but not always, longitudinally ribbed; and in the
radii often having more oblique summits. On the other
hand, considering the many points of identity between the
fossil and the recent specimen, I have concluded, without
much doubt, that they ought all to be classed together.
I may remark that, in the Coralline Crag specimens, the
spur of the tergum (Pl. <a href="#Page_688">4</a>, fig. <a href="#p04f04d">4 <i>d</i></a>), is unusually long and
narrow; it is broader and shorter in the Italian specimens
(<a href="#p04f04e">4 <i>e</i></a>), and variable in this respect, in the United States
specimens; the scuta of the Lisbon specimens are remarkable
for the greater prominence of the adductor ridge, and
for the depth of the lateral depressor cavity. Some of the
specimens from all the several localities are identical with
the recent ones from the coast of Peru. The walls of the
shell in the Coralline Crag specimens, are generally ribbed
longitudinally. I have entered into the above particulars,
on account of, in the first place, its offering an excellent
example how hopeless it is in most cases to make
out the species of this difficult genus without a large
series of specimens; secondly, as showing how the characters
alter with age; and thirdly, as a good instance of
the amount of variation which seems especially to occur in
most of the species which have very extensive ranges.</p>

a somewhat different aspect, can be distinguished from
certain varieties of <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a> only by their scuta being

in degree, and in most cases of very little value. Some of

and the great fossil Coralline Crag specimens, which
stand at the opposite end of the series of varieties, with their
ribbed walls, very oblique radii, and coarsely striated scuta,
are extremely unlike <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>. With respect to the no<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" href="#Page_238"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 238]</span></a>menclature
of the present species, I have little doubt that I
have properly identified the Italian fossil specimens with
<i>B. concavus</i> of Bronn, who has given a very good figure of
this species in his 'Lethæa Geognostica;' it must, however,
be confessed that the longitudinal striæ on the scuta are not
there represented. Considering the large size and frequency
of this species in Europe and in the United States, it has
probably received several other names, besides the two incorrect
synonyms, quoted at the head of this description.
I should add that the true <i>B. cylindraceus</i> (not <i>var.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>) of
Lamarck, according to the plate given by Chenu in his
'Illust. Conch.,' is the <a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> of South America. I
have seen in collections specimens of <a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>B. concavus</i></a> labelled as
<i>B. tulipa</i> of Poli (<a href="#Balanus_tulipiformis"><i>B. tulipiformis</i></a> of this work),—a very
natural mistake, without the opercular valves be carefully
examined.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, often steeply conical; orifice
rather small, with the radii narrow, and generally in the fossil specimens
very oblique; surface generally smooth, sometimes rugged, and
in the coralline crag specimens generally ribbed longitudinally, the
ribs being narrow. Colour various, either dull reddish-purple with
narrow nearly white, or wider dark longitudinal bands; or, again,
pale rosy-pink with broad white bands; or lastly, wholly white. The
radii are either darker or paler than the parietes. The opercular
valves are either dark purple or nearly white. Pale pink and white
stripes are visible on some of the Italian and Portuguese tertiary specimens;
and in most of the fossils the sheath is tinged dull red.</p>

<p><i>Dimensions.</i>—The largest actually recent specimen which I have
seen, from the Philippine Archipelago, had a basal diameter of 1.2 of
an inch; the Peruvian pleistocene specimen is 1.7 in diameter; specimens
from the crag and from the Italian deposits, however, sometimes
slightly exceed two inches in basal diameter, and three in height.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: these in young and moderately-sized specimens are striated,
sometimes very faintly, but generally plainly, causing the lines of
growth to be beaded; but often, in large and half-grown specimens,
the lines of growth are extremely prominent, and being intersected by
the radiating striæ, are converted into little teeth. As the striæ often
run in pairs, the little teeth frequently stand in pairs, or broader teeth
have a little notch on their summits, bearing a minute tuft of spines. In
very old and large specimens, the prominent lines of growth are generally
simply intersected by deep and narrow radiating striæ. In one case,
a single zone of growth in one valve was quite smooth, whilst the zones
above and below were denticulated. The valve varies in thickness,
which I think influences the prominence of the lines of growth and the
depth of the striæ. These striæ often affect the internal surface of the
basal margin, making it bluntly toothed. The articular ridge is rather<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239" href="#Page_239"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span></a>
small, and moderately reflexed: the adductor ridge (as already stated,)
varies remarkably; in most of the Panama specimens, it is extremely
prominent, and extends down to near the basal margin; in other specimens
it is but slightly prominent, especially in some of the fossil
specimens from Virginia. The cavity for the lateral depressor, also,
varies greatly; it is often bounded on the side towards the occludent
margin by a very slight straight ridge, which occasionally folds a little
over, making almost a tube; this, at first, I thought an excellent
specific character, but far from this being the case, the cavity often
becomes wide, quite open, and shallow.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>, very slightly beaked; the surface towards the carinal end of
the valve, in some of the fossil specimens, is very slightly striated longitudinally.
There is either a slight depression, or more commonly a deep
longitudinal furrow, with the edges folded in and touching each other,
extending down the valve to the spur, and causing the latter to vary in
width relatively to its length. When the furrow is closed in, the spur
is about one fourth of the entire width of the valve, and has its lower
end obliquely rounded, and stands at about its own width from the
basi-scutal angle: when there is only a slight depression and no
furrow (as is always the case with young specimens), the spur is
broader, equalling one third of the width of the valve, with its lower
end almost truncated, and standing at about half its own width from
the basi-scutal angle. But the absolute length of the spur, also, varies
considerably; it is often very long, compared to the whole valve. The
basal margin on the carinal side is sometimes slightly hollowed out;
when the furrow is closed, this latter side slopes towards the spur. Internally,
the articular ridge and crests for the tergal depressor muscle
are moderately prominent.</p>

<p><i>Parietes</i>, the longitudinal septa sometimes stand near each other,
making the parietal pores small. The <i>radii</i> have oblique summits,
but to a variable degree; their septa are unusually fine, and are denticulated
on their lower sides; the interspaces are filled up solidly. The
<i>alæ</i> have their summits very oblique, with their sutural edges nearly or
quite smooth. In most of the fossil specimens, and slightly in some
of the recent specimens, the surface of the sheath presents an unusual
character, in a narrow, longitudinal, slightly raised border, running along
the sutures, on the carinal side of each compartment.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i> thin, porose; sometimes with an underlaying cancellated layer.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with six teeth: mandibles with the fourth and fifth
teeth small, either sharp, or blunt: maxillæ with a straight edge, or with
the inferior part slightly prominent. <i>Cirri</i> with the rami of the first
pair unequal by four or five segments: the segments in the shorter
ramus are extremely protuberant. The segments in the second cirrus
only moderately protuberant: but all the specimens were in bad condition,
and it appeared as if, in the Panama specimens, the segments of
the second cirrus were more protuberant than in the Philippine Island
specimens. In the posterior cirri there are from three to five pairs of
spines on each segment: even amongst the Panama specimens some
had three and some four pairs, and a white Panama specimen had five
pairs of spines.</p>

<p><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240" href="#Page_240"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span></a></p>


<p class="p2">All the recent specimens which I have seen, were, with
one exception, attached to various shells and crabs, and to
each other. The Peruvian specimen was associated with
<a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a>. The tertiary specimens are often congregated
together into great masses. Including the recent and fossil
specimens, this species encircles the globe. During the miocene
period it seems to have been the commonest existing
sessile cirripede; now, it does not appear to be common,
excepting, perhaps, at Panama: Mr. Cuming procured only
one specimen from the Philippine archipelago.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">With respect to the nomenclature of this extremely
common species, which is widely distributed in all the
warmer seas (excepting, as far as I have seen, on the
west coast of America), there is some difficulty. I have
no doubt that it is the <i>Lepas radiata</i> of Wood (1815), but
Bruguière, in 1789, gave this same name to a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>
which he had not seen, but which is figured in Chemnitz,
Tab. 59, fig. 842. I should have thought that this also
had been the present species, but Spengler, in describing
(Skrifter af Naturhist. Selskabet i, B. 1790) this individual
specimen, which he calls <i>L. purpurea</i>, states that it is 13
lines in basal diameter; now this is a size which is never
acquired by <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>; and the description, habits,
and size, would apply equally well to the species which I
have called <a href="#Balanus_amaryllis"><i>B. amaryllis</i></a>; but when no notice is taken of
such points of importance, as whether the walls are permeated
by pores, whether the radii are smooth-edged,
whether the scuta are striated, it is impossible to identify
with any approach to certainty sessile Cirripedes; and the<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242" href="#Page_242"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span></a>
names given ought, in my opinion, to carry little weight with
them. With respect to Lamarck's <i>Balanus radiatus</i> (1818),
the synonyms quoted exhibit some great and inextricable
confusion. The <i>B. radiatus</i>, again, of Risso, is a fossil and
apparently distinct species. There can be no doubt that
the present species is the <i>Lepas balanoides</i> of Poli, (and of
several authors who have followed him), and equally little
doubt that the present species is not the true <i>L. balanoides</i>
of Linnæus, which has a membranous basis, and which I
have not seen from the Mediterranean. Under these circumstances
I have concluded that less confusion would be
caused by giving a new name to this species than by taking
that of Wood, which ought not to have been used by him,
considering Bruguière's previous adoption of it.</p>

<p>Under the head of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a> I have alluded to the
great variation of <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>, which consists not only in
a vast diversity in the colouring and in the general aspect,
but likewise in the degree of obliquity of the summits of
the radii, in the form of the terga, and slightly in that of
the scuta. In order to show that it has not been from
indolence that I have put so many forms together, I may
state that I had already named and fully described in
detail eight of the following forms as species, when I
became finally convinced that they were only varieties:
it would require at least thirty figures, which I have not
the power to give, fully to illustrate the transitional forms.
As with <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, the deception is wonderfully
enhanced by whole groups of specimens from the same
locality exactly resembling each other, and sometimes
differing from other groups attached to the very same
object. If a person were to get together only some fifty
or sixty specimens from only half a dozen different localities,
he would almost certainly come to the same conclusion,
as I at first did, that several of the varieties are
true species; but when he gets several hundred specimens
from all quarters of the globe, he will find, to his trouble
and vexation, that character after character fails and blends
away by insensible degrees, and he will be led, as the more
prudent course, to include, as I have done, and I hope
rightly, all under one specific name. I have experienced<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243" href="#Page_243"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span></a>
more doubt regarding the last variety, <i>cirratus</i>, than on
any other, on account of its peculiar colouring, and from
the basis being often irregularly cup-formed. Under
<a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>B. concavus</i></a> I have remarked how closely some of its
varieties approach to <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>, and it is to this last
variety that they approach; almost the only difference being
that the scuta in <a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>B. concavus</i></a> are longitudinally striated.
Yet some of the varieties of the two species are so distinct
that it would be puerile to class them together. I will
only add, that after studying such varying forms as <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>
and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a> it is difficult to avoid, in utter
despair, doubting whether there be such a thing as a distinct
species, or at least more than half a dozen distinct
species, in the whole genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>.</p>

<p>As with <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, I will first give a full description
of the more common forms, alluding only to each less
frequent variation, and then separately describe briefly the
more marked varieties.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shape conical, either steep or considerably
depressed; sometimes tubular; orifice either nearly entire or deeply
toothed, not large, varying from rhomboidal to rounded-trigonal. Surface
of shell smooth, never ribbed, generally naked, but occasionally the
yellowish epidermis is persistent; in the same individual, I have seen all
the lower part of the shell thus covered and the upper part naked, the
line of separation being defined. The <i>colour</i> varies much, even sometimes
considerably on the same individual; generally white or pale gray,
with dull violet-coloured, longitudinal, moderately broad stripes; these
stripes are sometimes equidistant, but more usually they are arranged
so as to leave broad white spaces; the stripes fade away by endless
variations, the edges of the compartments and the carinal end of the
shell longest retaining any colour, until we have a uniformly white
shell, generally covered with a yellowish epidermis; or the white
is longitudinally marked with hyaline lines; this latter variety
has a very peculiar aspect, and I did not doubt it was specifically distinct,
until, in a number of specimens on a ship from the West Indies,
I got the most perfect series, and another scarcely less perfect series
from the Mediterranean, graduating into common coloured varieties.
Rarely the dull violet or purple stripes become approximate and dark,
so that the whole shell is tinted of a brownish slate-colour, occasionally
freckled with white. Again, we have another set of very pretty varieties,
with a white or very pale pink ground, with either narrow bright pink
or broad pinkish-purple stripes. Again, I have seen numerous specimens
of a variety, <i>var. Stutsburi</i>, from the west coast of Africa, in which
the upper part of the shell is white, and the lower part shaded with<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244" href="#Page_244"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 244]</span></a>
pinkish or dark purple approximate stripes, which often become confluent;
in one group, the whole shell being thus uniformly coloured,
without any vestige of stripes. I have seen another group from an
unknown locality, in which the lower part of the shell was uniformly
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: blueish-grey">blueish-gray</span>. A variety from Australia has narrow approximate dark
claret-coloured stripes, transversely freckled with white. Lastly, in
the variety <i>cirratus</i>, the whole shell is very pale purplish-brown, with
indistinct longitudinal brownish stripes, transversely freckled with white
lines. I considered this as a distinct species, until quite lately finding
forms which I could not possibly determine whether to class as
<i>B. cirratus</i> or <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>.</p>

<p>The radii are generally snow-white, or freckled with a bright
mahogany tint, or rarely clouded with purple, or in the pink varieties
with pink. The scuta are dull purple or pink, generally with a white
band along their tergal margin; often, however, they are white, with
merely one or two purple fasciæ. The thickness or strength of the
shells varies much; some specimens attached to a floating cane, from
Natal and the Philippine Archipelago, were extremely strong; others,
from the Mediterranean and Australia, and some tubular varieties from
the West Indies, were very thin, translucent, and fragile. <i>Size</i>: large
specimens generally attain a diameter of from half to three quarters of
an inch in basal diameter; and I have seen one or two specimens an
inch in diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i>; sometimes the surface is very smooth, but generally the
growth-ridges are moderately prominent; the latter are occasionally
very finely beaded, and this seems always the case with <i>var. cirratus</i>.
Internally, the articular ridge is prominent and reflexed: the adductor
ridge is sharp, very prominent, and straight; it runs parallel to the
occludent margin; close to its lower side there is often a depression
(Pl. <a href="#Page_689">5</a>, fig. <a href="#p05f02i">2 <i>i</i></a>), sometimes bounded by a slight ridge, as if for the attachment
of a muscle, but there certainly is no muscle here: rarely
the adductor ridge is only slightly prominent: there is a small and
shallow little pit of variable depth for the lateral depressor muscle.</p>

<p><i>Tergum</i> (<a href="#p05f02k">2 <i>k</i></a>-<a href="#p05f02o">2 <i>o</i></a>); this valve is here far more variable than in any
other species: in the commonest purple-striped forms (<a href="#p05f02l">2 <i>l</i></a>), the
valve is rather broad, the basal margin lies in nearly a straight line on
the opposite sides of the spur, which is placed at rather less than its
own width from the basi-scutal angle; the spur is rather short, and in
width about one fourth of the entire valve; its lower end is either
bluntly pointed or more commonly nearly square (<a href="#p05f02k">2 <i>k</i></a>) and parallel to
the basal margin: in young specimens it is generally sharper than in
older ones. Externally, in the line of the spur, there is either a slight
longitudinal depression, or more rarely a deep furrow. The carinal margin
is more or less convex, and is formed by upturned lines of growth:
the scutal margin is broadly inflected. Internally, the articular ridge
in the upper part is very prominent: the crests for the tergal depressor
muscle are moderately prominent, but very variable. Sometimes the
carinal portion of the basal margin is slightly hollowed out. In <i>var.
Stutsburi</i> (<a href="#p05f02m">2 <i>m</i></a>, <a href="#p05f02n">2 <i>n</i></a>, <a href="#p05f02o">2 <i>o</i></a>), and in some white varieties, which differ most
in the shape of the tergum from the commoner varieties, the whole<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245" href="#Page_245"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span></a>
valve is narrower, the spur is much sharper and narrower, the carinal
half of the basal margin is much hollowed out and slopes down
towards the spur, with the crests for the depressor muscles depending
beneath the basal margin, and with the carinal margin sometimes
extremely convex or protuberant. But the shape and position of the
spur, and the outline of the carinal half of the basal margin vary much
in nearly all the varieties.</p>

<p><i>Compartments.</i>—The upper parts of the parietal pores are either
filled up solidly with, generally coloured, shell, or they are crossed by thin
transverse calcerous septa: the longitudinal parietal septa occasionally
bifurcate at their bases close to the outer lamina, making an irregular
outer row of minute pores. The <i>Radii</i> have their septa rather fine,
and finely denticulated on both sides, but sometimes only on the lower
side; the thickness of the septa varies a little; the interspaces are
filled up solidly; the summits of the radii are jagged and oblique, and
usually form an angle of about 45° with the basis, not being added to
above the level of the opercular membrane; but not rarely they reach
up much higher, and are very nearly parallel to the basis, extending
from tip to tip of the compartments. Again, in some ordinary varieties,
and always in <i>var. Stutsburi</i>, the summits of the radii are extremely
oblique, the radii themselves forming a mere border to the compartments
to which they belong. In no other species have I seen so great
an amount of variation in the form of the summits of the radii. The
<i>alæ</i>, in like manner, have their summits either very oblique, not being
added to above the opercular membrane, or they are only slightly
oblique; it often happens that in those specimens in which the summits
of the radii are nearly parallel to the basis, the alæ are very
oblique, and the converse: in other individuals, both radii and alæ have
equally oblique summits. The sutural edges of the alæ vary in thickness,
being either very thin and obscurely crenated, or moderately
thick and ribbed. The <i>basis</i> is porose; but I have never seen an
underlying cancellated layer of shell, as is so common in several
species.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum, with from four to eight, generally with six, little
teeth: mandibles with three teeth, and two minute lower teeth, or
mere knobs: maxillæ with the edge straight, or with the inferior part
forming a slightly step-formed projection. <i>Cirri</i>: the rami of the
first pair are unequal by three or four segments, but in some specimens
by five or six segments, with the front surfaces of the segments in the
shorter ramus extremely protuberant. The second pair of cirri are
short, with the front surfaces of the segments moderately protuberant:
the third pair have a tuft of bristles at their bases on the thorax. The
segments in the sixth pair have from four to six pairs of spines on the
segments; equal-sized specimens seem to vary in this latter respect.
There is a small sharp projection on the dorsal base of the penis.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>var.</i> 1, <i>communis</i>, I have nothing further to remark,
except that I have seen specimens identically similar from the Mediterranean,<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246" href="#Page_246"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span></a>
Natal, the Philippine Archipelago, and Sydney; at the
latter place it is said to be rare, but in most places it is the commonest
variety, and is often attached to ships' bottoms. Of <i>var.</i> 2,
<i>venustus</i>, I have seen specimens from the west coast of Africa, Natal,
and Ceylon, in groups by themselves, and associated with <i>var. communis</i>;
it is much less common than <i>var.</i> 1. The third variety,
<i>pallidus</i>, is not uncommon; I have seen many specimens from the
bottoms of ships, from the West Indies, and the west coast of Africa.
Of the <i>var.</i> 4, <i>niveus</i>, I have seen the most perfect graduated series
passing into <i>var.</i> 1, both from the West Indies, Florida, and the
Mediterranean: I have seen other specimens from the Red Sea and
Madagascar. Of the <i>var.</i> 5, <i>modestus</i>, I have seen only one group from
an unknown locality; it is only remarkable from its uniform colouring.
The <i>var.</i> 6, <i>Stutsburi</i>, is more remarkable than the foregoing; until
quite lately I did not doubt that it was specifically distinct; but as I
have seen every character graduate into other varieties, I am now convinced
that it is not a true species: all the specimens which I have
seen have come on shells, or on ships' bottoms, from West Africa.
Of <i>var.</i> 7, <i>obscurus</i>, I have seen three or four groups of specimens from
unknown quarters, both on pebbles, shells, and on cork (probably
from the Atlantic ocean); and likewise some specimens taken from
the bottom of Her Majesty's ship "Fly," on the east coast of Australia;
these latter are intermediate in character with the next <i>var. variegatus</i>;
from the Australian seas, which I at first ranked as an undoubted
species, but I have subsequently failed in discovering any sufficient
diagnostic character. Lastly, of <i>var. cirratus</i>, I have seen several
groups of specimens from India and the Philippine Archipelago, and a
group intermediate in character between this and the first and third
varieties, from Australia; I retained this variety owing to its peculiar
freckled, pale brown colouring and beaded scuta (of which, however,
I have seen decided traces in the common variety), as a distinct species,
after I had given up all the foregoing forms. I entertain some doubts
whether I have now acted right; but when I found some specimens
which, I found it impossible to decide, whether to rank as <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a> or
<i>cirratus</i>, I determined to take the more prudent course, and sink the
latter as a species. This variety, also, seems to connect <i>B. amphitrite</i>
and <a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>concavus</i></a> very closely.</p>

<p class="p2">The appearance of the fragile shell, in the one group of<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247" href="#Page_247"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span></a>
specimens which I have seen, leads me to suspect that they
may have grown under unfavorable circumstances. This
species differs considerably in general aspect, but not much
in essential characters, from <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>; the absence,
however, of an adductor ridge to the scutum, and the sharply
truncated spur of the tergum, are sufficient to distinguish
them. In the opercular valves this species comes near to
<a href="#Balanus_vinaceus"><i>B. vinaceus</i></a>, also from the west coast of South America;
but the striated scuta of that species, the cancellated inner
lamina of the parietes, the general colouring, and square
porose radii, are amply diagnostic characters.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell fragile, tubulo-conical, orifice large,
passing from diamond-shaped into oval. Colour fine dark rose,
freckled with transverse, sharply pointed, fine zig-zag white lines: the
pink is also so arranged as to obscurely give to the walls a longitudinally
striped appearance: radii generally rather whiter than the
walls, and similarly freckled: terga similarly freckled: scuta dull red,
with a white band along the scutal margin. Basal diameter of largest
specimen half an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i>, externally smooth: internally, articular ridge moderately
developed, slightly reflexed: there is no adductor ridge: there is a
distinct pit for the lateral depressor muscle. <i>Tergum</i>, with the scutal
margin unusually prominent, toothed: longitudinal furrow shallow, the
edges apparently having no tendency to fold in: spur short, barely one
third of width of valve, with the lower end sharply truncated, parallel
to the basal margin: articular ridge and crests for the depressores
moderately prominent.</p>

<p><i>Compartments.</i>—Walls very fragile, with the outer lamina not
thicker than the inner lamina. <i>Radii</i> fragile, broad, with their
summits moderately oblique; their sutural edges have the septa
plainly denticulated on both sides, with the interspaces filled up
solidly nearly to the tips of the septa. <i>Alæ</i>, with their summits
more oblique than those of the radii; their sutural edges smooth.
<i>Basis</i> with an underlying cancellated layer. <i>Mouth</i>: labrum with
three unusually large teeth on each side of the notch: mandibles with
the fourth tooth tolerably well developed, the fifth being confluent with
the inferior angle. <i>Maxillæ</i> simple. <i>Cirri</i>,—first pair with one ramus
longer by about four segments than the other ramus, which has considerably
protuberant segments: second pair with segments only
moderately protuberant: sixth pair with segments much elongated, but
bearing only four pairs of spines.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><span class="correction" title="In the original book the punctuation was missing."><i>General Appearance.</i></span>—Shell conical, or almost tubular; white, with
the surface very smooth, covered by thin yellowish epidermis, but with
the radii naked. Orifice large, passing from rhomboidal into pentagonal,
moderately toothed. Average full size, about one inch in basal diameter;
I have seen a specimen 1.3 in basal diameter, and the same in
height.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i>, plainly striated longitudinally: the teeth on the occludent
margin small. Internally, the upper surface is roughened: the articular
ridge is prominent, and either slightly or not at all reflexed: the pit for
the adductor muscle is distinct; the adductor ridge is prominent in a
variable degree, and is almost confluent with the articular ridge. In
one specimen from Beverly Bay, U. S., the scuta were extraordinarily
disintegrated, and I could perceive no trace of the external radiating
striæ. <i>Tergum</i>, with the basal margin on the carinal side of the spur
sometimes deeply (Pl. <a href="#Page_689">5</a>, fig. <a href="#p05f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>), and sometimes only slightly (fig. <a href="#p05f04d">4 <i>d</i></a>),
and rarely hardly at all, hollowed out: when much hollowed out the
valve may almost be said to be two-pronged, with the carinal prong
narrower than the spur. There is no distinct longitudinal furrow, but
the whole scutal margin projects above the general surface of the
valve. In the carinal margin, in the upper part, there is a remarkable
convexity or protuberance in the same plane with the valve, from
which it is separated by a very slight and narrow ridge. The spur is
about one fourth of the width of the valve, with its lower end abruptly
truncated. Internally, the upper surface is much roughened with
finely crenated ridges: the distinct crests for the depressores cover the
whole of the so-called carinal prong.</p>

<p><i>Compartments</i>; the radii and alæ have their summits oblique, sometimes
a little rounded, but not smooth. The septa on the sutural
edges of the radii are remarkably fine, and closely approximate; the<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249" href="#Page_249"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span></a>
denticuli are excessively minute. The sutural edges of the alæ are
most delicately crenated; the alæ are largely added to during the
diametric growth of the shell, and above the level of the opercular
membrane. The parietal pores are square and rather large: they are
crossed by transverse septa almost close down to the basis: the
longitudinal septa have tolerably large denticuli at their bases. The
pores in the basis are crossed by numerous transverse septa.
When specimens grow in a group, the basis is sometimes irregularly
cup-formed.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: <i>labrum</i> serrated with small teeth, decreasing in size downwards,
on each side of the central notch. <i>Mandibles</i> with the third
tooth rather thick and blunt, and with the fourth and fifth knob-like.
<i>Maxillæ</i>, with the inferior part projecting much beyond the rest of
the edge, and bearing two long single spines: between these two
spines and the large upper pair, there are, in a full-sized specimen,
about seven pairs of moderately long spines, feathered on their
sides. <i>Outer maxillæ</i> thickly clothed with very fine spines, and remarkably
prominent.</p>

<p><i>Cirri</i>: first cirrus, with one ramus having twenty-six segments, and
longer by ten segments than the shorter ramus, which has sixteen segments:
the shorter ramus, and both ramii of the second pair, have their
segments remarkably protuberant in front; the protuberance, in the
upper segments, equalling in length the supporting part of each
segment: rami of the second cirrus unequal in length by five segments.
Third cirrus with the segments only slightly protuberant; rami considerably
longer than those of the second cirrus: at the dorsal base of
the pedicel of this third cirrus there is no tuft of fine hairs, as is common
in many other species. <i>Sixth pair</i>, with the upper segments elongated,
bearing from six to seven pairs of spines; dorsal spines short, thin,
and few.</p>

<p><i>Affinities</i>: in external appearance of the shell, this species can
hardly be distinguished from some of the white varieties of <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>;
and there is a considerable resemblance, in some of the varieties,
in the opercular valves; but the longitudinally striated scuta of <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B.
eburneus</i></a> suffice to distinguish these certainly very distinct species.
Equally, or even more like <em>externally</em>, is this species to the <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a>,
so that I have received from an eminent naturalist in the United States
both species mingled in the same lot, all bearing the same name of
<a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>; but when the internal structure of the shell is examined,
the species are at once seen to be far removed from each
other. Still more close is the affinity of this species to <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>,
both in internal and external characters: it agrees with this species in
the singular habit of being able to live in brackish water: these two
species are the only ones which have the labrum serrated with teeth,
graduated in size, on each side of the central notch. In the case of
<em>young</em> specimens of the <i>var. assimilis</i> of <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>, an inhabitant
of the same seas with <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>, the diagnosis is most difficult without
long practice; for in the young of <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>eburneus</i></a>, the compartments are
only partially covered by yellow epidermis, and have a striped appearance,
the radii are sometimes very oblique, the scuta externally have<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250" href="#Page_250"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span></a>
not acquired their longitudinal striæ, and internally the adductor ridge
lies not so close to the articular ridge as it does subsequently; hence I
for some time mistook the <i>var. assimilis</i> of <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a> for the young
of <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>. But I found in the latter, that the rami of the first
pair of cirri, are always, even in the earliest youth, more unequal in
length, and that each segment of the posterior cirri bears a greater
number of pairs of spines, there being, even in very minute specimens,
seven pairs. Moreover, after having examined scores of specimens,
I found I could almost always distinguish the two species by the
smoothness and curvature of the summits of the radii of <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>;
I entertain no doubt whatever about the distinctness of the two species;
indeed, when both are mature, besides the greater size, striated scuta,
&amp;c. of <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>, their general aspect is very different.</p>

Indies, Rio Plata, Southern Patagonia, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Guyaquil">Guayaquil</span>, West Colombia; attached to
wood, shells, rocks, ships' bottoms, from low tidal level to twenty fathoms depth.</p>

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, with a rather large diamond-shaped
orifice, moderately or but little toothed; very smooth; walls
never folded longitudinally; white, with an extremely thin pale-yellow
persistent epidermis. The radii are very narrow, with their summits very
oblique, rounded, and smooth; the epidermis is generally more persistent
on the radii than on other parts, and this is exactly the reverse
of what is common with <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>. The specimens from nearly
fresh-water in the R. Plata (hereafter to be mentioned), are brownish, and
have undergone a remarkable degree of corrosion, the outer lamina of
the walls having been entirely removed to near the base; hence the
external aspect of these specimens is wholly different from ordinary individuals.
The <i>var. assimilis</i> has also a very different appearance,
owing to the dead white of the walls being relieved by narrow approximate
longitudinal hyaline lines, corresponding with and caused by
the longitudinal parietal septa being externally visible through the outer
lamina of the parietes; the epidermis on the radii is also of a rather
brighter yellow. The largest specimens which I have seen are those
from the Plata, and those attached to a ship from the West Indies, and
they had a basal diameter of .6 of an inch: from .4 to .5 of an inch is
the more usual full average size.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, with the lines of growth but little prominent: articular ridge<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251" href="#Page_251"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span></a>
prominent, but little reflexed: adductor ridge straight and very prominent,
varying a little in its distance from the articular ridge; there
is scarcely any depression for the lateral depressor muscle; the upper
internal surface of the valve is roughened with ridges. <i>Terga</i>, with a
moderately deep longitudinal furrow; spur short, rather narrow, with
the end rounded, placed at less than its own width from the basi-scutal
angle; in the Rio Plata specimens the spur is close to this angle: the
basal margin is generally straight on opposite sides of the spur, but
sometimes on the carinal side it is a little hollowed out. The lines of
growth are upturned along the carinal margin, which consequently is
a little protuberant, but to a varying degree. The crests for the depressores
are extremely distinct and prominent. In the varieties having
the basi-carinal margin hollowed out, and the carinal margin protuberant,
there is a marked resemblance to the peculiar tergum of <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B.
eburneus</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Walls</i>: the parietal pores are tolerably large, and are crossed by numerous
transverse septa: the longitudinal septa are very finely denticulated
at their bases, but occasionally almost smooth. The <i>radii</i> are,
as stated, extremely narrow, and very remarkable from their smooth
rounded edges; their septa are barely denticulated. The <i>alæ</i> are remarkably
protuberant; they have their summits much less oblique than
those of the radii, and sometimes they are almost parallel to the basis:
their sutural edges are coarsely crenated. <i>Basis</i>, flat, thin, permeated
by pores, but the pores do not generally run to the very centre; they
are, as usual, crossed by transverse septa.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: the <i>labrum</i> is the most remarkable part; on each side of
the central notch there are generally two teeth; and on the two sides
of the notch itself nine or eleven smaller teeth, decreasing regularly
in size downwards till they become so minute as to be hardly visible
even under the compound microscope; thus, in the two specimens
closely examined, there were altogether twenty-two and twenty-six
teeth on the labrum. <i>Mandibles</i> with the two inferior teeth reduced to
mere knobs: <i>maxillæ</i> with the lower part of the edge bearing two large
spines, and generally, but not always, forming a step-formed projection.
<i>Cirri</i>: the ramii of the first pair are but slightly unequal; in one
specimen examined there were fifteen segments in one ramus and
twelve in the other: segments very protuberant in front. Second
cirrus with the segments only slightly protuberant; segments thirteen.
Third cirrus longer than the second pair, with the rami rather unequal
in length: there is a tuft of long spines on the basal segment of the
pedicel of this cirrus. Fourth cirrus twenty-two segments. Sixth
cirrus, in the same individual, thirty-four segments: on each of these
segments there are five or six pairs of spines. I may specify that the
longer ramus of the first cirrus of a large Rio Plata specimen had
twenty-four segments.</p>

<p><i>Varieties, affinities.</i>—When I first met with the <i>var. assimilis</i>, misguided
by its general aspect, I did not doubt that it was specifically
distinct; I was strengthened in this view by the absolute identity of
several hundred specimens attached to two vessels from Jamaica and
Trinidad, in the West Indies, with one specimen from Charlestown, in<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252" href="#Page_252"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span></a>
the United States, sent me by Prof. Agassiz, and with several in three
lots from the western tropical shores of South America: yet on close
examination I can point out no one distinguishing character, either in
the shell or animal's body, excepting the longitudinal hyaline lines on
parietes, due to the septa being externally visible. The presence of
similar lines is variable in white <i>vars.</i> of <a href="#Balanus_amaryllis"><i>B. amaryllis</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>,
and they are seen in very young specimens of <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>: hence it is
impossible to consider so trifling a character as specific; moreover,
lately I have seen a British specimen with hyaline lines, and some few
other specimens in an intermediate condition. Under the head of
<a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>, I have stated that although that species and <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>,
which in the West Indies are associated together, are most readily discriminated
when old, yet when young, they so closely resemble each
other that the eye requires much practice to separate them. On account
of this species and <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> being sometimes associated together on
the shores of England, I have pointed out under <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, the relative
diagnostic characters of the two. The chief affinity of <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a> is
certainly towards <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>; but in the narrow, oblique, rounded,
and smooth-edged radii, there is a relationship shown to the species
in the last section of the genus, such as <a href="#Balanus_amaryllis"><i>B. amaryllis</i></a>, and more especially
to the fossil <a href="#Balanus_dolosus"><i>B. dolosus</i></a>: so close is the resemblance in the external
appearance of the shell, and in the structure of the opercular valves, to
the latter species, that I for some time did not discover their distinctness.
<a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>Balanus improvisus</i></a> has hitherto been overlooked by naturalists, and has
probably been confounded with <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> or <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>balanoides</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Range and habits.</i>—This species, as far as my experience goes, is
commoner on the shores of Kent than on other parts of England: the
first specimens which I met with, I owed to the kindness of Mr. Metcalf,
they were attached to wooden stakes from Herne Bay, together with a
single specimen of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>: I have seen other specimens from near
Woolwich, from the Kentish oyster-beds, from Sandwich, and from
Ramsgate. The only other British specimens which I have seen are
from the River Itchen, in Hampshire, and from Loch Shieldaig, in
Ross-shire (Mus. Jeffreys), from a depth of twenty fathoms. This
species is often attached to wood. At Ramsgate, the specimens were
attached to a small coasting vessel, and they must have been immersed
five or six feet; they were associated with <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, and with a few
of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>. In the Brit. Mus. there are specimens collected by
Mr. Redman, from Nova Scotia, in North America. When her Majesty's
ship Beagle was beached at Santa Cruz, in Southern Patagonia, numerous
specimens were found adhering to her copper bottom, some so
small as to show that the species breeds in those latitudes. Near
Monte Video, in the estuary of La Plata, I found many large, but much
corroded specimens, adhering to some rocks in a small <em>running</em> stream
of perfectly fresh water. The rise of the tide is here small, but at
high water the specimens apparently were for a short time covered by
the waters of the estuary, here itself only brackish, and occasionally
almost fresh. I took home some specimens, and placing them in perfectly
fresh water they continued for many hours expanding and
retracting their cirri with perfect regularity and vigour. Here then we<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253" href="#Page_253"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span></a>
have a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> capable of living in fresh water, and likewise in the
saltest seas: even brackish water is a deadly poison to several, probably
to most, species of the genus; but this, as we have seen, is not
the case with the allied <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>. The water, I may add, at
Woolwich, on the Thames, whence I have received <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>, must
at times be very brackish. I have already incidentally mentioned that
the <i>var. assimilis</i> was attached in great numbers, associated with <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B.
eburneus</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>tintinnabulum</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>, on vessels from the West
Indies: one specimen sent me by Prof. Agassiz, from Charlestown, was
attached to a specimen of <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>; and, lastly, I have seen three
sets of the same identical variety attached to shells from Guayaquil (in
Mus. Brit. and Cuming), and from West Colombia. Here, then, we
have the same species with an enormous range, from Nova Scotia and
Great Britain to South Patagonia; and, which is the case with scarcely
a single mollusc, it lives both on the eastern and western tropical shores
of the South American continent.</p>

<p class="p2">I have seen two specimens of this species, brought by
Lady K. Douglas from California; and two from Monterey,
sent me by Dr. Aug. Gould. This is a very distinct species,
coming nearer to <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a> than to any other species: it
is also allied to <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a>. In the basis being in parts
solid or not permeated by pores, it has claims to be placed
in the next section, in which I at one time included it.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, rugged, sometimes furnished
with sharp longitudinal ribs; dirty white. Orifice not large, oval,
toothed. Radii rather narrow, with their summits oblique, much
jagged. Basal diameter of largest specimen 2.1; height only 1.3 of
an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, broad, with the lines of growth prominent; internally,
articular ridge very little prominent, sometimes hardly developed,
but thick, ending downwards in a small free point. Adductor ridge<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254" href="#Page_254"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span></a>
prominent, blunt, produced straight downwards, making a deep longitudinal
cavity for the lateral depressor muscle; in some specimens
this cavity is almost arched over, so as to tend to be tubular, with a
short ridge in the middle (Pl. <a href="#Page_690">6</a>, fig. <a href="#p06f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>): in other specimens there
is no trace of this tubular structure. <i>Terga</i>, with the apex beaked,
beak triangular, dull purple; the longitudinal furrow is so shallow as
hardly to exist. The basal margin slopes down on both sides, with a
nearly equable curvature towards the spur; hence the spur is broad in
its upper part, and narrow at its obliquely truncated lower end. Internally,
there is an elongated dark purple patch: the shallow articular
furrow is of quite remarkable breadth; the articular ridge is medial,
and the inflected scutal margin is not wide. The internal surface of the
spur is formed into a ridge, which runs a little way up the valve, and is
sometimes partially separated from the spur itself (fig. <a href="#p06f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>), making
the basal extremity toothed or double. The crests for the depressores
are pretty well developed.</p>

<p><i>Walls</i>, moderately strong: inner lamina slightly ribbed: the denticuli
on the bases of the parietal longitudinal septa are sharp: I could not
see any transverse septa in the parietal tubes. The <i>radii</i> are rather
narrow; their summits are remarkably jagged and very oblique; the
septa are plainly denticulated on both sides, but chiefly on the lower
side; each septum itself, towards the inner lamina of the radius, branches
and divides: the interspaces are filled up nearly solidly. The <i>alæ</i> have
apparently their summits less oblique than those of the radii: their
sutural edges are finely crenated. The lower edge of the sheath is hollow
underneath. The <i>basis</i> is flat; it is rather thin, and imperfectly porose;
in parts it is not at all porose, in others it is traversed only by very
minute pores: there is nevertheless, in some parts, even where the
upper layer is not porose, an underlying, cancellated layer.</p>

<p class="p2">I have seen only two specimens of this species attached
to rock, collected by Mr. Greenough, at Colle, and kindly
given by him to me. The species comes near to the living
<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, also found fossil in deposits of this same age;
it differs, however, distinctly from that species, in having its
basis permeated by pores, and, in a less degree, in the
sutural edges of the radii being more plainly crenated: the<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255" href="#Page_255"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span></a>
opercular valves of the two species closely resemble each
other. This may be the <i>B. stellaris</i> of Bronn, but it is
futile attempting to identify the species of this genus merely
by external characters, even when aided, as in this case, by
<span class="correction" title="Darwin's errata not applied. Darwin's errata: six lines from the top, Bal. crenatus, I have now seen a single Red Crag specimen .5 of inch in basal diameter.">an excellent drawing of the shell</span>.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, with broad rounded longitudinal
folds; orifice of moderate size, oval; radii narrow, with their upper
margins oblique; but the summits of both specimens had been much
broken. Colour, as it appears, originally white. Basal diameter of
largest specimen 3/4 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, with the upper portion much reflexed; the articular ridge is
very prominent, and the articular furrow of great width; when the valve
is viewed from the outside the articular ridge is very conspicuous: there
is no adductor ridge. <i>Terga</i>, with the longitudinal furrow very slight;
the spur is from one third to one fourth of the width of the valve, and
its basal end is blunt and almost truncated; it stands about half its own
width from the basi-scutal angle. Internally, the articular ridge is very
prominent, and the articular furrow narrow and deep, extending down
the valve in the line of the spur.</p>

<p><i>Parietes</i>: the parietal tubes are remarkably large, and I think this
can hardly be an individual peculiarity: the tubes are crossed by many
transverse septa, close down to the basis. The <i>radii</i> are narrow, and
have jagged, oblique summits: their sutural edges have very distinct
septa, barely denticulated, with the interspaces filled up solidly. The
<i>alæ</i> have oblique summits; I was unable to make out the structure of
their sutural edges. The <i>Basis</i> is very distinctly permeated by pores,
which are crossed by transverse septa.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">The shell and opercular valves of <a href="#Balanus_corrugatus"><i>B. corrugatus</i></a> so closely
resemble the same parts in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, that I should not
be much surprised at seeing the two species graduating into
each other, if a larger series of specimens, from beds intermediate
in age between the Sub-Appennine formations and
the present time, were obtained. If indeed the basis of
<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> were permeated by pores, the two species could
hardly be discriminated.</p>

Davis's Straits, 66° 30′ N.; Lancaster Sound, 74° 48′ N. (Mr. Sutherland).

mammaliferous and Red Crag of England; Mus. Lyell, Sowerby, S. Wood, &amp;c.</p>

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, somewhat convex; white, sometimes
tinted yellowish, from the thin investing membrane; the produced
tips of the terga are purple: the parietes of each compartment have
from two to four strong, prominent, sharp, straight longitudinal ribs;
these are sometimes irregular, and rarely, as will presently be described,
they are absent. The radii are smooth and of considerable breadth;
their summits are nearly parallel to the basis or only slightly oblique:
hence the orifice is entire; it is rather small and ovate, being broad at
the rostral end, and very sharp and narrow at the carinal end.</p>

<p><i>Dimensions.</i>—The largest specimens which I have seen from Great
Britain or Ireland, have been 1.3 of an inch in basal diameter: in
Mr. Cuming's collection, however, there was one much depressed specimen
from the Shetland Islands, 2.1 in basal diameter: a regularly
conical specimen from the coast of Massachussetts attained a nearly
equal diameter; out of the glacial deposits in the Isle of Bute, Scotland,
several specimens had this same diameter, namely, two inches,
and were even more steeply conical, being 1.85 in height; some glacial
specimens from Uddevalla and Canada, in Sir C. Lyell's collection, were
1.7 in basal diameter. Hence, it appears, as we shall presently see is
likewise the case with <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>Hameri</i></a>, that northern specimens,
and those from the United States and from the glacial deposits, often
exceed in dimensions those from Great Britain or Ireland.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i>: the lines or ridges of growth are broad and prominent;
they are divided into square beads by fine striæ, radiating from the
apex: and hence the valve is longitudinally striated. Internally, the
articular ridge is extremely little prominent; the adductor ridge, or
what must be called such, runs straight down under the articular ridge,
making a deep longitudinal pit for the lateral depressor muscle.
<i>Tergum</i>: the apex is a little produced, and coloured purple, as well as
the upper internal surface of the valve; there is no longitudinal furrow,
only a very slight depression: the spur is placed close to the basi-scutal
angle; it is rather long, and measured across the upper part, is half as
wide as the valve: its lower end is truncated and rounded; the basal
margin slopes towards it. Internally, a very small portion of the
scutal margin is inflected: the articular furrow is shallow and broad:
the crests for the depressores are feeble. In young specimens the spur
is bluntly pointed.</p>

<p>The <i>Parietes</i> (<a href="#p06f04e">4 <i>e</i></a>) have large square parietal tubes: in the upper part
these are filled up solidly without transverse septa: the longitudinal
septa are finely denticulated at their bases, and the denticuli extend<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258" href="#Page_258"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span></a>
unusually close to the outer lamina. In very young specimens the
inner lamina of the parietes is ribbed, in lines corresponding with the
longitudinal septa, as is the case with most species of the genus; but
in medium and large-sized specimens, there are between the ribs, thus
produced, from one to four smaller ribs, which do not correspond with
any longitudinal septa; they are finely denticulated at their bases, and
may be considered as the representatives of longitudinal septa which
have not been developed and reached the outer lamina. I have seen
no other instance of this structure, namely, the presence of a greater
number of ribs, on the inner lamina of the walls, than there are longitudinal
septa. The <i>radii</i> have their summits generally parallel to the
surface of attachment, as is usual in the first section of the genus, but
sometimes they are slightly oblique: the septa sometimes rudely branch
a little, but they exhibit scarcely a trace of denticuli: the interspaces
are filled up quite solidly. The <i>alæ</i> have their summits very oblique;
their sutural edges are finely crenated.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i>, rather thin, translucent, not permeated by pores; obscurely
furrowed in lines radiating from the centre: the circumference is
marked in a peculiar manner by the longitudinal septa, and by the
tips of those intermediate, denticulated ribs, which occur on the inner
lamina of the parietes.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with six teeth: mandibles with the fourth and fifth
teeth small and rudimentary: maxillæ, with a small notch under the
upper pair of spines; in the lower part there is a single large spine.
<i>Cirri</i>, dark brownish purple, making a singular contrast with the white
operculum and shell; first pair, with one ramus, having twenty-six
segments, and about twice as long as the shorter ramus, having twelve
or thirteen segments, with their front surfaces protuberant. In the
second pair the segments are but little protuberant: third pair about
one third longer than the second pair: sixth pair, elongated, having in
the same individual forty-six segments; these segments have shield-shaped
fronts, bearing five pairs of spines, with some minute intermediate
bristles. There is the usual point at the dorsal base of the penis.</p>

<p><i>Range: Geological History.</i>—This species is common on the shores
of Scotland and Ireland; the most southern point of Europe whence
I have happened to see a specimen is Tenby, in South Wales: but I
have no doubt it is found further south; and Mr. Jeffreys, who knows
this species well, has found it common on the extreme southern
shores of England. In the United States, it is found on the shores of
Maine and Massachussetts: northward, I have seen specimens from
Iceland, from Davis's Straits, and from Lancaster Sound, in lat. 74°
48′ north; these latter I owe to Sir J. Richardson. It is an inhabitant
of deep water; in Mr. Thompson's collection there are several specimens
from the Bay of Belfast, marked twenty-five fathoms, and one group said
to have come from "about fifty fathoms, on the coast of Antrim:" one
specimen from Cape St. Anne, Massachussetts, is marked as having come
from only five fathoms. This species is commonly associated, on both
sides of the Atlantic, with <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, and sometimes with <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a>
and <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>Verruca Strömia</i></a>: mollusca, such as pectens, modioli, and oysters,
offer the most usual surfaces of attachment: I have, however, seen many<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259" href="#Page_259"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span></a>
specimens on crustaceans, on rocks, and even on the roots of the larger
sea-weeds. This species is very common in the glacial deposits of
Uddevalla, of Skien in Norway, and of Canada, and is associated with
the same species as in the living state: I have seen, also, specimens from
the same formation in the Island of Bute, Scotland. I have seen
numerous specimens from the mammaliferous crag, and a few from
the Red Crag of England. I owe to the kindness of Mr. J. de C.
Sowerby an inspection of the original specimens of the <i>B. tesselatus</i> of
the Mineral Conchology, which is certainly the present species.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species is very distinct from every other; it comes
nearest, as shown in all the characters derived from its opercular valves,
to <a href="#Balanus_nubilus"><i>B. nubilus</i></a>, and in this latter species we have seen the basis plainly
tending to lose its pores and thus become solid. <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a> is perhaps
allied in some degree to <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>B. trigonus</i></a>, and slightly to <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>. The
rather broad radii, with their summits hardly oblique, give this species
a very different aspect from those species of the genus amongst which
it must be placed.</p>

<p><i>Varieties.</i>—A conical specimen, sent to me from the coast of Massachussetts,
is remarkable from the radii not having been at all developed,
being represented by mere fissures. I have seen a few specimens of
<i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>), (one collected by Sir E. Parry in the arctic seas) which had a
remarkably different aspect from the common forms, but which, after
a careful examination of the opercular valves and of the animal's body, I
feel convinced are not specifically distinct: they are characterised by the
walls being smooth and absolutely destitute of the external longitudinal
ribs; by the shell being more cylindrical, with broader radii, and with
the orifice larger and more rhomboidal; the walls and radii are much
thinner, and the internal lamina is less plainly ribbed: the beak of the
tergum is not purple. As most of these specimens had grown in a
group crowded together, the difference of shape, and perhaps the thinness
of the walls, is thus explained. In a specimen from Davis's Straits,
in Mr. A. Hancock's collection, most of the above characters are in an
intermediate condition; there are only a few external longitudinal ribs
on the parietes; and the terga have not purple apices. In Mr. Cuming's
collection there are some fine, brilliantly white specimens (<em>without
opercula</em>) from the coast of China; these have thin walls and radii,
and the walls are not longitudinally ribbed, but they are not smooth:
the orifice is not large, nor the shape of the whole shell cylindrical.
It is just possible that these latter specimens may be a distinct and
representative species, but I do not think so.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell depressed, sometimes much depressed:
orifice elongated, rhomboidal, but little toothed; surface smooth, but in
old specimens sometimes with the walls slightly folded longitudinally.
The radii are rather narrow, with their summits oblique; in old specimens
their summits are rounded, and their whole surface finely ribbed parallel
to the basis. Colour, in old specimens dirty brown, tinged with violet,
sometimes in longitudinal bands, and with whiter irregular marks in the
upper parts owing to disintegration: in young specimens the walls are
regularly banded longitudinally, with violet-brown and dirty white; the
radii being generally of a paler dirty red or violet. Basal diameter of
largest specimen .9 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, externally rather smooth; internally, articular ridge prominent,
reflexed, with the lower edge hollowed out so as to be slightly
hook-formed: adductor ridge small; there is a slight pit for the
lateral depressor. <i>Tergum</i>, with the spur bluntly pointed, placed at
about its own width from the basi-scutal angle; there is no longitudinal
furrow, only a slight depression; carinal margin arched and
protuberant: internally, articular ridge extremely prominent, running
down in the direction of the middle of the spur: crests for the tergal
depressores well developed.</p>

<p><i>Parietes</i>, with the pores rather large; the internal lamina is very
strongly ribbed, the ribs being but slightly denticulated at their bases:
the parietal pores do not appear to be crossed by transverse septa:
sheath closely attached to the walls. The radii have jagged oblique
summits forming an angle of about 45° with the horizon; in old specimens
they become more oblique and narrow: and are then very
remarkable from their summits being arched and rounded, with a crenated
edge, and with their whole surface transversely ribbed in horizontal
lines; this is likewise the case with the recipient furrow in the
opposed compartments: in young specimens the radii are externally
quite smooth: the septa on the sutural edges are bluntly denticulated;
the interspaces being filled up solidly. The alæ have their summits
oblique, but much less oblique than the summits of the radii; their
sutural edges are very finely crenated.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i> thin, either quite solid, that is, not permeated by pores, but only
furrowed in lines radiating from the centre, or permeated by pores
towards the circumference, the pores being of very small diameter;—so
that we here have an important character variable within the limits
of the same species. Base flat, and this holds good, as remarked by
Spengler, even when the specimens are attached to cylindrical pieces of
wood.</p>

perhaps, shows more affinity to <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a> than to any other
species; it is, however, almost equally allied to <a href="#Balanus_glandula"><i>B. glandula</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">I find, in most collections, this species confounded with
<a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>; I have even seen the two species, placed by
Leach, on the same tablet in the British Museum: <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>
is, moreover, generally confounded with <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus
stellatus</i></a>; nor has any one hitherto separated the present
species from <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>. On the other hand, trifling
varieties, both of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, have commonly
been considered as specifically distinct. From these<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262" href="#Page_262"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span></a>
facts it will be seen in what confusion our commonest British
species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> have been left. After due deliberation,
I have little doubt that this is the <i>B. crenatus</i> of Bruguière,
and probably the <i>B. rugosus</i> of Montagu, but this latter
author omits all reference to the really important diagnostic
characters between this species and <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>. The
<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> is certainly the <i>B. rugosus</i> of Dr. Aug. Gould.
In various collections, I find specimens of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>,
when coming from the arctic regions, called <i>B. glacialis</i>,
<i>arcticus</i>, and <i>borealis</i>; though I have not met with an
authentic specimen of the <i>B. glacialis</i> of Gray ('Supp.
Parry's Voyage,' 1819, p. ccxlvi), I have little doubt that
it would prove to be the present species.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—White, usually of a dirty tint, from the yellowish
or brownish persistent epidermis: conical, generally (fig. <a href="#p06f06a">6 <i>a</i></a>)
with the parietes rugged and irregularly folded longitudinally; but sometimes
much depressed and extremely smooth (<a href="#p06f06b">6 <i>b</i></a>); often cylindrical and
very rugged; occasionally club-shaped (<a href="#p06f06c">6 <i>c</i></a>), the upper part being much
wider than the lower: specimens in this latter condition sometimes
have extremely narrow parietes, like mere ribs, and wide radii.
The orifice in the cylindrical varieties is often most deeply toothed.
The radii are generally narrow, and have jagged oblique summits; but
not infrequently they are so narrow as to form mere linear borders to
the compartments. The orifice is rhomboidal, passing into oval,
either very deeply or very slightly toothed.</p>

<p><i>Dimensions.</i>—The largest British specimen which I have seen was
only .55 of an inch in basal diameter: specimens from Greenland and
the northern United States frequently attain a diameter of three-quarters
of an inch, and I have seen one single somewhat distorted
specimen actually 1.6 of an inch in basal diameter. The specimens
from the glacial deposits of Uddevalla and Canada appear, on an
average, to attain as large or larger dimensions than those from the
United States: on the other hand, the specimens from the mammaliferous
and Red Crag are smaller, the largest being only .35 in basal diameter.
When individuals have grown crowded together, their length
is often twice, and even occasionally thrice, as great as their greatest
diameter; thus I have seen a Greenland specimen 1.6 of an inch in
length, and only .75 in diameter. In the British Museum there are some
arctic specimens, one and a half inch in length, only half an inch in
diameter at the summit (fig. <a href="#p06f06c">6 <i>c</i></a>), thence tapering downwards to a
blunt point.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>; the lines of growth are but little prominent: the surface is
generally covered by disintegrating membrane. The upper ends are
usually a little reflexed, so that the tips project freely as small flattened
points. Internally, the articular ridge is highly prominent and somewhat
reflexed: there is no adductor ridge, but a very distinct impression
for the adductor muscle: the depression for the lateral depressor<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263" href="#Page_263"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span></a>
muscle is small, but variable. The <i>terga</i> are rather small: the spur is
short, and placed at rather less than its own width from the basi-scutal
angle; the basal margin slopes a little towards the spur, of
which the lower end is rounded or bluntly pointed in a variable degree.
There is no longitudinal furrow, hardly even a depression. Internally,
the articular ridge is very prominent in the upper part; the crests for
the tergal depressores are well developed, but variable.</p>

<p><i>Compartments.</i>—The internal carinal margin of each compartment,
from the sheath to the basis, generally, but not invariably, projects a
little inwards beyond the general internal surface of the shell, in a
manner not common with the other species of the genus: the basal
edge of this projecting margin rests on the calcareous basis, and is crenated
like the basal edges of the longitudinal parietal septa. The
whole internal surface of the shell is ribbed, but the ribs are not very
prominent. The parietal tubes are large, and are crossed in the upper
part, and often low down, by transverse thin septa: the longitudinal
parietal septa are only slightly denticulated at their bases; occasionally
they divide at the basis close to the outer lamina of the parietes,
making some short outer subordinate pores. In the circular furrow
beneath the lower edge of the sheath, there are sometimes little ridges,
dividing it into small cells: sometimes, however, this furrow is filled
up by irregular knobs of calcareous matter. The <i>radii</i> are always
rather narrow, and often they form mere linear ribbons of nearly uniform
width along the edges of the compartments. Their summits or
edges are always more or less irregular and jagged: they form an
angle with the horizon of generally above 40°. Their septa are fine,
and barely or not at all denticulated. The alæ have oblique summits:
their <span class="correction" title="In the original book: suteral">sutural</span> edges are rather thick and distinctly crenated. <i>Basis</i>
flat, calcareous, very thin, with the surface slightly marked by radiating
furrows, which furrows answer to the radiating pores that occur
in the bases of most species. In a club-shaped arctic specimen, one
inch and a half in length, the summit being half an inch and the base
only one fifth of an inch in diameter, the basis was still calcareous,
thick, and not permeated by pores.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with six teeth: mandibles with the fourth tooth
minute or rudimentary, and the fifth generally confluent with the inferior
angle. Maxillæ with generally, but not invariably, a small notch
under the upper pair of great spines. <i>Cirri</i>, first pair with the rami
very unequal in length, one ramus being nearly twice the length of the
other; in a large specimen having a cylindrical shell the proportional
numbers of the segments in the two rami of the first cirrus were ten to
twenty-three; in a small conical specimen the numbers were only eight
to thirteen. The second cirrus has only two or three more segments than
the shorter ramus of the first pair: the third cirrus has one or two more
segments than the second; but it is nevertheless decidedly longer than
the second. On the dorsal surfaces of both segments of the pedicel of
the third cirrus, there is a tuft of fine spines. The segments of these
three pairs of cirri are not much protuberant in front. The segments
of the posterior cirri have, each, four, or five, or six pairs of spines.
<i>Penis</i>, with a straight, sharp, short point on the dorsal basis.</p>

<p><i>Range, habits, &amp;c.</i>—I have received specimens from all parts of the
coast of Great Britain and Ireland, generally attached to crustacea and
mollusca, and never hitherto from rocks uncovered by the tide. This
species is also attached to floating timber, sticks, fuci, and occasionally
to pebbles at the bottom of the sea. Mr. Thompson has sent me specimens
from twenty-five fathoms depth in Belfast Bay: others on a
Pinna from <i>about</i> fifty fathoms on the coast of Antrim; others from
between three and six fathoms attached to Laminaria digitata: there
is a specimen in Mr. Jeffreys' collection marked forty-five fathoms. It
is often associated, both on the coasts of America and Britain, with <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B.
porcatus</i></a>, and though these species are so distinct, yet when both have
their surfaces similarly affected by being attached, as is often the case,
to large Pectens, it is not at first easy, by external characters, to distinguish
them, except by close inspection of the terga, which in <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B.
porcatus</i></a> are beaked and purple. The <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> is sometimes
associated in deep water with <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a>. At Ramsgate, in Kent, I
saw a rudder of a ship, in which the two or three upper feet were
thickly coated with <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, and the two or three lower feet
with <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>improvisus</i></a> mingled, together with a few of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>:
occasionally vessels are thickly <span class="correction" title="In the original book: incrusted">encrusted</span> with this species,
but I have never seen an instance of its concurrence with <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>
and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>—the commonest species on ships coming from the
south. I have seen specimens from Greenland, Baffin's Bay, the coast
of Labrador, and other specimens marked simply, "Arctic regions,"
and, again, others from the shores of Maine and Massachussetts.
The arctic specimens, and those from the northern United States, are
larger than the British. I have seen one single minute specimen on a
crab, marked as having come from the Mediterranean. In the British
Museum, amongst some specimens of <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>, ticketed as having
been sent from Jamaica, there was a small group of specimens, differing
in no one essential respect from the common varieties of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>:
at first I concluded that this was an erroneous habitat, and that the
specimens had really come from the United States, where <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>,
is found as well as in the West Indies: for it appeared to me
exceedingly improbable that an animal which can exist in lat. 75° N.
should inhabit the hot shores of Jamaica: but subsequently I have received
a specimen from Prof. Krauss, collected by himself in Algoa
Bay, which is perfectly characterised, and even has the little cells in
the furrow under the sheath: so that I am compelled to admit this
enormous range and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: cabability">capability</span> of resisting the most extreme climates.
That this species should live in the tropical seas is the more surprising,
as the large size of the specimens in the northern seas and in the glacial
deposits, might fairly have been supposed to have indicated special
adaptation for a cold climate. The great geographical range of this
species accords with its range in time from the present day to the Coralline
Crag period.</p>

<p>The specimens from the glacial deposits which I have examined,
chiefly in Sir C. Lyell's collection, are very fine and large; they are
often associated, like the now living individuals, with <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a> and
<a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>Hameri</i></a>: they come from the well-known formation of Uddevalla and<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265" href="#Page_265"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 265]</span></a>
from Canada. There are well-characterised specimens in the mammaliferous
Crag, at Bramerton and near Norwich, in Sir C. Lyell's collection,
and from Sutton and other places in the Red Crag of the
eastern shores of England: these specimens are decidedly not only
smaller than the glacial, but than the recent English specimens; for
the largest Crag specimens which I have seen had a basal diameter of
only .35 of an inch. The specimens which I have seen from the Coralline
Crag, and some others sent me by Krantz from the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: miocence">miocene</span> formation
of Flonheim bei Abzei, in Germany, had not their opercular
valves, yet I cannot doubt, considering how few species there are in the
present section of the genus, that I have rightly identified them.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>—Under the head of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> I shall make a few remarks
on the diagnosis between that and the present species; as <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>
is found on the British shores, sometimes mingled with <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B.
crenatus</i></a>, I may observe that, externally, the only difference consists in
the edges of the radii in <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a> being much smoother and
rounded, and in the whole shell being less rugged. Internally, in <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B.
improvisus</i></a> the porose basis, the presence of an adductor ridge on the
under side of the scutum, the graduated teeth on each side of the central
notch in the labrum, and the little inequality in length of the rami of
the first pair of cirri, are clearly and amply diagnostic.</p>

<p><i>Shell white; parietes with the internal lamina generally
strongly ribbed longitudinally, with the pores imperfect
and small, sometimes in part absent; radii narrow, with
their summits rounded. Scutum with an adductor ridge;

<div class="habitat">

<p class="p2"><i>Habitat.</i>—California, Mus. Cuming, Aug. Gould; attached to shells and
wood, together with <a href="#Balanus_nubilus"><i>B. nubilus</i></a>. Southern Pacific ocean, attached to <i>Pollicipes

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell steeply conical, or cylindrical and
elongated; dirty white; walls rugged, longitudinally folded; radii
narrow, with their summits very oblique and rounded; orifice toothed.
Basal diameter of largest specimen half an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i>, resembling externally that of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>; rather broad,
surface smooth; articular ridge very prominent, and articular furrow
very wide; hence, when the summits of the opercular valves are worn
down, the two scuta together form a square projection indenting the
two terga, as in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>. Internally, there is a small adductor
ridge, on the lower side of which there is a pit, as if for a muscle. The
depression for the lateral depressor muscle is small, but variable.
<i>Tergum</i> without any longitudinal furrow, and hardly a depression: spur<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" href="#Page_266"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span></a>
broad, with its lower end truncated and rounded; internally, articular
ridge very prominent; crests for the depressores well developed.</p>

<p><i>Compartments</i>:—The internal surface of the parietes is smooth in
the upper part beneath the sheath, but generally very strongly ribbed
in the lower part, the ribs being plainly denticulated at their bases; in
other specimens, the ribs are very small, and even in parts quite
obsolete. The parietal pores are short and imperfect, sometimes reduced
to an extremely minute size, to be detected only when the walls are
broken across near the basal edge, and most carefully examined; occasionally
not even a trace of a pore exists. Hence in this respect,
this species offers a singular case of variation. The <i>radii</i> are narrow,
and of nearly the same width from top to bottom; their very oblique
summits, when well preserved, are smooth and rounded; their sutural
edges are ribbed or crenated with extremely fine, smooth septa; the
recipient furrow is plainly marked by these septa. The sutural edges
of the alæ are crenated; their summits are less oblique than those of
the radii.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i>, thin, finely furrowed in lines radiating from the centre;
margin sometimes deeply sinuous.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with the central notch rather widely open, with four
teeth on each side of it: palpi with very short spines along their inner
margins: mandibles with the fourth and fifth teeth forming mere knobs:
maxillæ small, with a mere trace of a notch under the two great upper
spines. <i>Cirri</i>; first pair with the rami unequal by three or four segments,
the longer ramus being only one quarter of its own length
longer than the other ramus. Second pair short, with the segments
(and those of the shorter ramus of first pair) somewhat protuberant.
Third pair with the rami one third longer than those of the second
pair. Sixth pair with the upper segments elongated, and bearing six
or seven pairs of spines.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species in general appearance closely approaches
<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>balanoides</i></a>, and it is related to them in many essential
parts, such as in the opercular valves. It agrees with <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>,
and differs from <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, in the smallness and imperfection of the
parietal pores, and in the radii having rounded summits; it agrees
with <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> in the structure of its basis, and in the prominent
longitudinal ribs on the internal surface of the parietes, and differs
from that species in the spur of the tergum being squarer, and in the
scutum having an adductor ridge.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>—From the appearance of the Californian specimens, I suspect
that they had adhered to tidal shells and to wood. The specimens in the
British Museum, adhering to <i>Pollicipes polymerus</i>, consist of two lots,
one of unknown origin, and the other certainly brought from the
southern half of the Pacific Ocean by Sir James Ross: it deserves
notice, that the <i>Pollicipes polymerus</i>, the supporting object, ranges
from California to the southern Pacific Ocean.</p>

shells, and wood, within the tidal limits.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">I have no doubt that the present species is the <i>Lepas
balanoides</i> of Linnæus; though O. Fabricius is the only
author who gives, in his "Fauna Groenlandica," a sufficient
description for the species to be recognised with certainty.
I believe this also is the <i>B. balanoides</i> of Bruguière, though
he is in error, as far as my experience goes, in stating that<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268" href="#Page_268"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 268]</span></a>
the basis is ever calcareous. I have little doubt, also, that
this is the <i>B. vulgaris</i> of Da Costa. The <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, in
its corroded and therefore punctured state, is certainly the
<i>B. punctatus</i> of most British collections; but I do not believe
it is the <i>B. punctatus</i> of Montagu, which I have
scarcely any doubt is the <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>, so often
found in the southern shores of England, and even in some
of the best arranged collections, mingled with our present
species.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shell, in middle-sized and old specimens,
is almost invariably folded longitudinally and irregularly; it is either
dirty white or very often pale brown, and punctured from the outer
lamina having been corroded, to which action it is extremely subject.
In very young specimens, the surface is usually quite white and smooth.
The shell is sometimes much depressed; generally conical, but when
crowded together, cylindrical or club-shaped, one specimen being even
more than five-and-a-half times as long as wide. In Mr. Jeffreys' collection
there is a specimen 2.5 of an inch long, .45 in diameter at the
summit, only .2 in the middle, and rather more than .2 near the base.
Another specimen was 1.8 in length, its greatest diameter being .35
of an inch at the summit. On the other hand, I have seen a very
depressed variety, with deeply folded walls, in Mr. Thompson's collection
from near Dublin, which was no less than four times as wide as
high; so that the difference in proportion of height and greatest width,
in the two extreme specimens, was nearly as 10 to 1. Occasionally,
from some unknown cause, isolated specimens become cylindrical. The
orifice of the shell, in the much elongated specimens, is generally
deeply toothed. The radii are always narrow, sometimes extremely
narrow, and have their summits smooth and rounded.</p>

<p>English specimens do not usually attain half an inch in basal
diameter; I have, however, seen one from near Yarmouth .9 of an inch
in diameter. Specimens from Massachussetts seem rather larger than
the average size of British specimens, many being .6 of an inch, and
one specimen a whole inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>opercular</i> valves so closely resemble those of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, that
the description is necessarily comparative; in some cases they could
hardly be discriminated; generally, owing to the disintegration to which
this species is subject, the tips of the scuta are worn off, and hence the
articular ridges together form (Pl. <a href="#Page_691">7</a>, fig. <a href="#p07f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>) a square projection,
indenting the two terga; but I have examined young specimens and
others when not disintegrated, in which the opercular valves, viewed
externally, presented no difference whatever from those of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>.
The <i>scuta</i>, however, are, I think, generally rather thicker, with the
growth-ridges more prominent, and with the tips certainly less reflexed
than is usual with <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>. Internally, the articular ridge is
rather less prominent: there is no distinct adductor ridge. The <i>terga</i>
are often rather narrower in proportion, and this especially holds good<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269" href="#Page_269"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span></a>
in the elongated varieties; in these latter, there is occasionally a moderately
deep longitudinal furrow: the spur is often exactly the same
shape as in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, but it is apt to be rather longer (Pl. <a href="#Page_691">7</a>, fig. <a href="#p07f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>)
and more pointed: in <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>) it is pointed (fig. <a href="#p07f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>) in a very remarkable
manner. Internally, the articular ridge is decidedly more prominent
than in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>; the crests for the tergal depressor muscles
are either well developed or almost absent. From this description it will
be seen, how singularly the opercular valves of the common varieties of
these two species resemble each other. I may mention that in some
of the much elongated specimens, the muscles going to the opercular
valves partially lose their transverse striæ, and become ligamentous.</p>

<p>The <i>Parietes</i> are either quite solid, or more commonly are permeated
by minute pores, or by small irregular square tubes (Pl. <a href="#Page_691">7</a>, fig. <a href="#p07f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>),
which only run up each successive zone of growth, for very short distances,
giving to the shell a cancellated structure, which from corrosion is
often externally visible. In the rather rare variety (<i>a</i>) the parietes are
permeated by regular tubes, extending up to the apices of the compartments,
but crossed by transverse septa. The longitudinal septa, when
such can be said to occur, in no case are denticulated at their bases.
The internal surface of the parietes is either quite smooth or is traversed
(Pl. <a href="#Page_691">7</a>, fig. <a href="#p07f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>) by very slight anastomosing ridges, but never,
even in <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>), by regular longitudinal ribs, as in most other species.
The carinal margin of each compartment, on the inside, projects, as in
<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, inwards, beyond the general surface of the shell, and running
down, rests on the basal membrane. The lower edge of the
sheath is rarely hollow beneath. The walls are lined by purplish, or
pale brown, or sometimes by almost black corium; numerous tubuli
penetrate the under sides of the walls and opercular valves; and it is
the intersection of these tubuli that gives the punctured appearance
to the often corroded surface of the shell. The <i>radii</i> are narrow,
generally very narrow; they have their upper and outer margins, as
seen externally, very oblique, rounded and (when well preserved)
smooth; their sutural edges are either quite smooth, or sometimes
just perceptibly pitted, like the basal margin of the walls, or occasionally
furnished with globular or arborescent little ridges. The
<i>alæ</i> are also very oblique, but to a variable degree, sometimes only
slightly oblique: their sutural edges are either smooth or obscurely
crenated. <i>Basis</i>, membranous; in some much elongated specimens,
during continued growth, the basal edges of the compartments approach
each other so closely as almost to touch, so that the whole shell becomes
pointed at the bottom; but on careful inspection I have never
failed to find, even in the most pointed specimens, a minute basal
membrane; in other much elongated varieties, in which the shell has
apparently become too large for the animal's body, the basal membrane,
instead of being flat, becomes drawn up deeply inwards, so as to
touch the surface of attachment only close round the basal edges of
the shell.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with the teeth on each side of the central notch
unusually variable in number; I have seen specimens with only two
on each side, with four on each side, with five on one side and four on<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270" href="#Page_270"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span></a>
the other, with five on one side and none on the other, and with six on
both sides; hence the total number ranges from four to twelve. Mandibles,
with the fourth and fifth teeth small, or quite rudimentary.
Maxillæ, with scarcely even a trace of a notch under the upper pair of
spines. <i>Cirri</i>; first pair, with one ramus one third or one fourth
longer than the other; in one specimen the number of segments were
nine and sixteen in the two rami: second and third cirri short, very
nearly equal in length, having in the just-mentioned specimen respectively
ten and eleven segments; the sixth cirrus in this same specimen
had twenty-five segments, each segment being about as long as broad, and
supporting six pairs of spines. In the singular variety (<i>a</i>) the posterior
cirri are more elongated, and each segment supports seven or
eight, and in one case even ten pairs of spines! the third pair is also
in this variety proportionally rather longer. At the base of the third
pair there is a tuft of fine spines. The penis has not, as in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>,
a point at its dorsal basis. The branchiæ are very little plicated.</p>

</div>


<h4><a name="Balanus_balanoides_Varieties" id="Balanus_balanoides_Varieties" /><i>Varieties.</i></h4>

<div class="detail">

<p>Of the varieties having much elongated, club-shaped, hour-glass
shaped, and depressed shells, there is no necessity to say anything in
particular. With respect to the remarkable variety (<i>a</i>), I at first named
and described it as a distinct species: I have received two lots, both from
North America, one being sent me by Professor Agassiz from Cape Cod.
These agreed in having the parietes permeated by regular tubes; in
having the spur of the tergum most sharply pointed; in the third pair
of cirri being proportionally longer compared with the second pair; in
the sixth pair having more numerous segments, namely, three times as
many as in the third pair; in the segments of the posterior cirri being more
elongated, and especially in the number of pairs of spines on each segment—amounting
in one case even to ten, a number unparalleled in other
cirripedes. It may naturally be asked why I have not retained so well
marked a form as a distinct species? In the first place, I found the most
remarkable character in <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>), namely, the number of pairs of spines
on the posterior cirri variable, there being in one lot seven or eight pairs,
and in the other lot nine or ten pairs on each segment. Secondly, all the
characters by which this variety differs from the common <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>,
are those which are variable in the latter; this is especially the case with
the structure of the parietes, and in a lesser degree with the spur of the
tergum. Thirdly, I found a specimen in Mr. Cuming's collection, from
Sweden (so that this <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>) is not confined to North America), in
which the cirri quite resembled those of the American specimens, but
the spur of the tergum was in an intermediate condition as compared
to that of ordinary varieties; and the parietal tubes were of unequal
sizes, and scarcely more regular than sometimes in the true <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>.
And lastly, I have seen specimens from Ayrshire, with the parietes permeated
by regular tubes, but with the tergum in an intermediate condition,
and with the segments of the posterior cirri not more numerous
or more elongated than in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, supporting only six or seven
pairs of spines, that is only one more than is common with <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>;
so that it was impossible to decide whether to rank the Ayrshire<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" href="#Page_271"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</span></a>
specimen under <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>) or under the common form, so that I was
compelled to give up <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>) as a species.</p>

<p><i>Monstrous individuals, with the male organs aborted: Parasite.</i>—Amongst
some specimens, chiefly elongated ones, sent to me from
Tenby, in South Wales, I found no less than seven individuals with
some of the posterior cirri distorted, unequal on the opposite sides,
and in an almost rudimentary condition, and in each case with the penis
truncated, without any muscle entering the stump, which was <em>absolutely
imperforate</em>: the vesiculæ seminales were much shrunk;
in one case without any zoosperms; in another case with headless
zoosperms cohering in an unusual manner; hence it is certain that
these individuals were functionally only female, and could not impregnate
their own ova; yet in two instances the ova had been impregnated,
no doubt by neighbouring perfect individuals, for they contained well-developed
larvæ. Several of these monstrous individuals were infested
by one, two, or three curious crustaceans, which have been described
by Mr. Goodsir,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[97]</span></a> as the male of the <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>; but these supposed males
are females, and were distended with ova containing almost mature larvæ;
I believe that they are the females of the unnamed genus, belonging to
the family of Ioniens, described by Mr. Goodsir, which live parasitic
within the sack (as I likewise found) of the same individual Balani.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>—I have seen several specimens of this species and of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B.
crenatus</i></a>, absolutely undistinguishable in external appearance. I may
specify one of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, imbedded in an alcyonidium, and one of
<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, imbedded in a sponge, and therefore neither at all abraded.
Generally, the tips of the scuta in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> are a little reflexed,
whereas in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, when the shell has been at all disintegrated,
the tips form a square projection locked into the terga. <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>Bal. crenatus</i></a>
never assumes the punctured appearance so common in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>.
Very young specimens of the latter can be distinguished by their dead
white colour and smoothness. The edges of the radii are almost always
smoother than in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, and they are never so wide as is sometimes
the case with <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>. When a specimen is disarticulated,
our present species can at once be distinguished from <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> (and
from <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a>), by its membranous basis, and by the solid or
cancellated walls, which are rarely permeated by regular tubes or pores;
and the walls when porose are not internally ribbed. I have already
pointed out the few very trifling points, in which the opercula of the
two species differ. The mouth and cirri offer likewise very few differences:
in <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> there are often more teeth on the labrum than
in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>; the rami of the first cirri are perhaps here rather
less unequal; the second and third pairs of cirri are certainly in
most cases more equal in length; and lastly, the segments of the sixth
cirri, even in the common varieties, bear, in equal-sized specimens, more
pairs of spines than in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>. We shall see that in habits, with
regard to depth, the two species differ, <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> inhabiting much
shallower water than <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Range, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Habits">Habitats</span>, &amp;c.</i>—This species is extraordinarily abundant within<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272" href="#Page_272"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</span></a>
the tidal limits round the shores of Great Britain, and apparently of
the northern United States. Besides numerous specimens sent to me
from very many English localities, the late Mr. W. Thompson, of
Belfast, kindly placed in my hands his very large collection; from these
materials it appears that <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> is the only tidal species in the
northern parts of our island; but in the south and south-west, it is
associated with the <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>Balanus perforatus</i></a>. I
doubt whether this species ever lives below the lowest tides; the case
of a few specimens being mingled with <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>crenatus</i></a>,
(mentioned under the latter species,) at the bottom of a rudder of a small
vessel, about six feet deep, is hardly an exception, for the water would
there be troubled and aërated almost as in a breaker; and on this very
rudder the upper two or three feet were coated exclusively by the <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B.
balanoides</i></a>. This species lives on rocks at both the uppermost and
lowest limit of the tides; I am informed by Mr. Thompson, that he
has seen specimens attached to a spot not covered by water during
neap-tides. As a proof of its tenacity of life, Mr. Thompson informs
me that he accidentally kept some specimens in a box, in a warm sitting-room,
and found them alive seven days afterwards. This same
most accurate observer finds, however, that <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> is very
susceptible to brackish water; he says, "that having kept some specimens
alive for a week in excellent health, the water being changed once
in thirty-six hours, they were one day killed instantly by some water,
though brought from the same part of the estuary as usual, having
been rendered brackish by much rain having lately fallen." I may
recall the fact, that <a href="#Balanus_improvisus"><i>B. improvisus</i></a> lives daily for hours in absolutely
fresh running water.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> lives attached, often continuously coating many
square feet of the surface, to rocks, pebbles, wooden-piers, littoral
shells and ulvæ. The most northern point whence I have received
specimens, is in lat. 66° 34′ in North America, collected by Mr. Sutherland;
and the most southern point is Delaware Bay, in the United
States, in lat. 39°; I do not believe that this species extends into the
Mediterranean, for Ranzani (Mem. di Storia Nat.), who particularly
attended to the nature of the basis, was not acquainted with any
<i><a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a></i> having a membranous basis; and Poli (Test. Ut. Siciliæ,)
describes only two species thus characterised, and these are manifestly
<i>Chthamali</i>.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">With respect to the rate of growth of this species, I am
indebted to Mr. W. Thompson for the following note:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sept. 29, 1848.—I examined a great number of Balani, in reference
to the growth made by them during the present season, and found it
to average three lines in diameter, and at most four lines. I saw
a few minute specimens, only one line in diameter, showing that the
species continued to breed until lately: these latter were probably not
more than four weeks old. The young of the present year are plainly
distinguished from the older ones, by their pure white colour and fresh
appearance. Judging from the size of this year's specimens, and of<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273" href="#Page_273"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 273]</span></a>
the older ones on the same stones, I am of opinion that the term of life
of the species is two years. Of the older shells, which I examined and
found living in the spring, nine tenths are now dead, the walls only
remaining, the opercular valves having been washed away."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Thompson goes on to say, that the individuals which
had, on July 3, a basal diameter of from two and a half to
three lines, had attained, by the 30th of September, a diameter
of four and a half lines, this being here the maximum
size of the species.</p>

<div class="habitat">

<p class="p2"><i>Hab.</i>—Columbia River, west coast of North America, Mus. Brit. and
Cuming; Behring Straits (Capt. Kellett); the Kurile Islands, according to
Pallas. Attached to shells, and to each other in groups.</p>

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell steeply conical, with a rather small
oval orifice; or cylindrical, with a large rhomboidal and little toothed
orifice. Colour dirty white. Surface either simply rugged, or more
commonly covered by numerous, narrow, extremely prominent, longitudinal
plaits; from the manner in which these overlap each other, the
shell almost appears as if thatched with straw. The upper corroded
part of the shell usually exhibits a cancellated and finely punctured
surface. The radii are generally very narrow, forming towards the
base of the shell a mere narrow ribbon to each compartment, and
often hardly distinguishable; but in one specimen they were of considerable
width: in the former case, the alæ are often widely exposed.
The largest specimen which I have seen was 1.5 of an inch in basal
diameter, but Pallas gives 2.2 as the measurement of a specimen from
the Kurile Islands.</p>

<p>The opercular valves are united to each other and to the shell by
unusually strong membrane; and the upper parts of both valves, in all
the specimens seen by me, have been much disintegrated. The <i>Scutum</i>,
in old specimens, is faintly striated longitudinally, but in some there is
hardly a trace of this: the occludent margin is furnished with a few
large knobs, not corresponding with every alternate line of growth (as
is usual with other species), but with every fourth or fifth line. Internally,
the articular ridge is moderately prominent (in young specimens
more prominent) and reflexed. The adductor ridge is sharp and<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274" href="#Page_274"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 274]</span></a>
prominent; in the upper part it is confluent with the articular ridge,
but in young specimens can be seen to be distinct; in the lower part it
borders a large deep cavity for the lateral depressor muscle, in the
middle of which there is a very slight longitudinal ridge; this cavity
sometimes is almost closed or arched over in its upper part. In one
specimen, the basal margin of the scutum was deeply hollowed out in
the middle. The <i>Tergum</i> is remarkably narrow, with its apex produced
into a triangular beak, hollow within, and sometimes faintly tinged
purple. A deep, closed, longitudinal furrow runs down the valve. The
spur is long, remarkably narrow, and pointed. Internally, the spur is
produced up the valve as a ridge: the inflected scutal margin, and the
prominent articular ridge, are both nearly straight, and parallel to the
spur. The crests for the depressores are sharp and very prominent.</p>

<p>The <i>Parietes</i> are very thick and strong: unlike every other species of
the genus, they consist of several very irregular rows, of unequally sized,
round or angular tubes (<a href="#p07f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>). These tubes or pores are generally short,
and are at frequent intervals crossed by transverse septa; they often
rather deserve to be called cells than tubes. New tubes are formed
along the inner as well as along the outer lamina. They are lined by
dusky purple corium. The internal surface of the parietes is smooth
in the upper part, and in the lower, it is reticulated by slight, irregularly
branching ridges. The carinal internal margin of each compartment
projects a little, as in the case of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>balanoides</i></a>.
The lower edge of the sheath is either hollow beneath, or is united to
the walls. The <i>radii</i> in one specimen were broad, with slightly
oblique, jagged summits; generally they are extremely narrow, forming
more ribbons along the lower edges of the compartments, barely extending
up as high as the sheath. They can sometimes hardly,
or not at all, be seen, until the shell is disarticulated: in rather young
specimens the sutural edge is sometimes quite smooth; in old specimens
the lower part of the edge has coarse arborescent septa, with the
interspaces filled up solidly, whilst the upper part is smooth. The
<i>alæ</i> are conspicuous from the outside, owing to the little development
of the radii; but owing to the diametric growth not having been great,
the part added during such growth is narrow; the summits of the alæ
are only slightly oblique: the sutural edge is coarsely crenated, with
the teeth denticulated or slightly arborescent.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i> membranous.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with only four very minute teeth: mandibles with
four teeth; the third tooth broader than the first; the fourth small.
Maxillæ, with the two upper spines placed on a slight prominence,
beneath which there is a small notch. <i>Cirri</i> of a very dark colour
(much injured): the segments of the first, second, and third pairs very
broad and short, protuberant in front, and most thickly clothed with
spines; the third pair is very little longer than the second pair: the
sixth pair (in a large specimen above one inch in basal diameter) had
the segments broader than long, each furnished with seven pairs of
spines.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species, though very distinct, evidently comes near
to <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, especially to <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>). By merely doubling or<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275" href="#Page_275"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span></a>
trebling the irregular rows of short tubes in the walls of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>,
with their reticulated inner lamina and longitudinally folded outer
lamina, we should have the structure exhibited in <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a>. We
have seen, also, that in <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>) of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, the spur of the
tergum is remarkably sharp, as in <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a>. This species, also, in a
very marked manner approaches in many characters, especially in the
opercular valves, in the cirri, and to a certain extent in the shell and
basis, to <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a>, and even in external appearance to <i>var. sordidus</i>
of the latter—an inhabitant of the opposite extremity of the continent,
namely, of Tierra del Fuego. Again, the tergum to a certain extent,
and the scutum in a singular manner, resemble these valves in <a href="#Balanus_nubilus"><i>B.
nubilus</i></a>, showing an unequivocal affinity to that species. With respect
to the most remarkable character of the species, namely, the several
irregular rows of tubes or pores in the walls, it deserves notice that in
<a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, which is certainly closely allied to <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, the
longitudinal septa sometimes divide near the outer lamina, thus giving
rise to a few additional tubes. Of the above several species, to which
our present species is allied, <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a> stands in the next section, and
<a href="#Balanus_nubilus"><i>B. nubilus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>crenatus</i></a> in the last: hence we see that <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a>
has singularly divergent affinities. The peculiar structure of the
parietes, together with the general appearance of the shell, made me at
the first moment suppose I was examining a <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> (or Conia
of Leach); hence, also, it has arisen, that <i>Lepas cariosa</i> of Pallas
has often been quite erroneously given as a synonym of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita
porosa</i></a>.</p>

doubt but that it was an <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>: on examination, however,
it is found to have a membranous basis, and therefore
cannot by the definition enter into that sub-genus, to
which, however, it is very closely allied. It differs from
other sessile cirripedes very remarkably in the rostrum
being nearly twice as long as the carinal compartments, so
that the basis is always very oblique, or placed almost on
one side; in this elongation of the rostrum, although in a<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276" href="#Page_276"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span></a>
different direction, we are reminded of <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a> and its
allies; and these latter we know can hardly be separated from
certain species of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>. Hence the position of our present
species in this section, is not natural; but I am unable
to place it elsewhere, without breaking down every definition:
it should stand somewhat isolated, on one side of
a line of affinity connecting <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>Balanus calceolus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_navicula"><i>navicula</i></a>
with <a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>Acasta purpurata</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shell is thin, fragile, smooth, and white,
but covered to a considerable extent by a brown membrane, which on
the sheath and opercular valve is of a bright tint, and clothed with
bristles. Viewed laterally, the rostrum is seen to be considerably
bowed, and from its being nearly twice as long as the other compartments,
with its lower end bluntly pointed, the basal margin of the whole
shell is rendered very oblique, forming a slightly concave line. The
lateral compartments are rather longer, and about one third broader
than the carino-lateral compartments. The rostrum, from terminating
downwards in a blunt point, instead of being square or truncated, as
in all other Cirripedes, and from the upper end being, as is usual,
pointed, has, when disarticulated from the other compartments, the
shape of a boat. The parietes are not at all porose: their internal
surface sometimes shows traces of longitudinal ribs, but sometimes
there are none. The radii are narrow, with their summits very
oblique, and their sutural edges smooth. The sutural edges of the alæ
are likewise smooth. The largest of Mr. Cuming's specimens was
.2 of an inch in diameter; but a disarticulated specimen in the British
Museum must have been larger, having a rostrum .3 in length. The
<i>Basis</i> is membranous.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> are rather convex; they have their lines of growth
approximate, most finely crenated, so as to be very feebly striated longitudinally.
Internally, the articular ridge is pretty well developed, its
lower edge being very oblique; there is barely an adductor ridge: the
pit for the lateral depressor muscle is deep. The spur of the <i>Tergum</i>
is placed close to the basi-scutal angle of the valve; it is about half as
wide as the valve, with the lower end truncated: sometimes it may be
rather said to be bluntly pointed, owing to its carinal side sloping up
to the basal margin. The articular ridge is pretty well developed.
The crests for the depressor muscles are barely discernible.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_98_98" id="Footnote_98_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> Sir C. Lyell remarks that this is apparently the <i>B. Uddevallensis</i> (Linn.) of
Swedish lists of fossils. Prof. E. Forbes has shown (Mem. Geolog. Survey of
England, vol. 1, p. 364) how this name arose, from a short description, prior to
the introduction of the binomial system, "Lepas quæ Balanus Uddevallensis,"
given by Linnæus in his Wast-Gotha Resa, in 1747.
</p>
<p>
For the reference to Ascanius' work, which is on the binomial system, and
subsequent to the 10th edit. of Linnæus, in 1758, I am greatly indebted to Mr.
Sylvanus Hanley. Had it not been for this gentleman, I should have used
Müller's name of <i>B. tulipa</i> as the first name.</p></div>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General appearance.</i>—Shell tubulo-conical, very smooth, white, generally
more or less covered by yellow thin membrane: orifice large,
sub-triangular: radii moderately broad, with their more or less oblique
summits slightly rounded and smooth; from this circumstance the
shell has been justly compared to the half-opened flower of a white
tulip. Specimens often exceed an inch in basal diameter; I have seen
one from Scarborough two inches in diameter and one and three quarters
in height: another specimen was 1.6 in diameter and 3 in height.
The specimens in the glacial deposits seem even to have acquired larger
dimensions, one from Uddevalla being nearly four inches in height.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, elongated, flat, feebly striated longitudinally: internally, articular
ridge short, moderately prominent: adductor ridge, confluent in
the upper part with the articular ridge, running straight down and
forming a rather large cavity for the lateral depressor. <i>Terga</i> feebly
striated longitudinally, with a longitudinal furrow, having the sides,
in old specimens, partly closed in: the basal margin slopes much
towards the spur, which is rather long and narrow, with its end
rounded: it is placed at about its own width from the basi-scutal
angle. Internally, articular furrow narrow; crests for the depressores
moderately prominent, but in a variable degree.</p>

<p><i>Compartments</i>: these are unusually thin, and separate easily: the
parietes are finely ribbed longitudinally on their insides; the bases of
these ribs being just perceptibly denticulated. <i>Radii</i>, with their
summits oblique (usually at about an angle of 45°), slightly arched
and quite smooth: the smoothness is produced by the edge being a
little inflected: sutural edge quite smooth, without even a trace of
septa or denticuli. <i>Alæ</i> oblique, generally rather less oblique than the
summits of the radii: sutural edges smooth, with an excessively fine
linear furrow running along the edge, a little towards the inner side,
and filled with a yellow ligamentous substance: a furrow of this kind
I have seen in no other species.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i>, solid, not permeated by pores; either smooth, or slightly furrowed
in lines radiating from the centre.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with scarcely perceptible minute bead-like teeth thinly
scattered along the edge. <i>Palpi</i> and <i>outer maxillæ</i> rather sparingly
clothed with hairs. <i>Mandibles</i> with teeth rather sharp; the fourth
and fifth teeth small, but well developed; inferior angle pointed with
fine spines. <i>Maxillæ</i> with a deep notch under the two upper great
spines. <i>Cirri</i>, the first pair is short, with rami of nearly equal length:
the segments are not protuberant in front either in the first or second
pairs. In the posterior cirri, the segments bear four pairs of spines,
with a tuft of rather long intermediate spines: in young specimens there
are only three pairs: the spines in the dorsal tufts are short and thin.</p>

<p>When the shell is disarticulated, this species cannot be confounded
with any other; but judging by external characters alone, it may<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279" href="#Page_279"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span></a>
sometimes be very easily confounded with <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a>, and I have received
the two species under this one name from Massachussetts:
generally <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a> may be distinguished from <a href="#Balanus_eburneus"><i>B. eburneus</i></a> by the
smoothness of the summits of its radii, and by the so-called epidermis
being of a darker yellow.</p>

<p>With respect to the fossil specimens from the glacial deposits, I have
little to add; I have seen one from Uddevalla, as already remarked,
four inches in height, and a lateral compartment broader by one fourth
than the same compartment in any recent specimen. As Sir C. Lyell
remarks (Phil. Transact.), the compartments are always found separated,
which is accounted for by their weak union in a recent state.
This species, when fossil, is usually associated with its deep-water
congeners <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>crenatus</i></a>, as at the present day.</p>

<p>I must here mention that I have examined a considerable number of
<em>separated</em> compartments, without opercular valves, brought from <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Barbadoes">Barbados</span>,
in the West Indies, showing the existence there of a closely
allied or possibly identical species. The only difference which I can
point out in these compartments is, that the parietes are rather thicker,
and the radii rather narrower, with more oblique summits: some of
the compartments are two inches in length. It seems very improbable
that the true <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a> should extend to the West Indies, but after
what has been seen in the case of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, this is possible.</p>

moderately large, very slightly, or deeply notched: surface
very smooth: white, longitudinally banded with pinkish or leaden
purple, with sometimes a purplish, sometimes a yellowish tint, the<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280" href="#Page_280"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 280]</span></a>
latter owing to the persistent epidermis; the bands are pale, and often
fade away in the lower, and sometimes in other parts of the shell; the
epidermis is generally more persistent on the narrow rounded radii
than on the parietes, and hence the radii are generally yellowish. The
opercular valves are pale dull purple: the sheath is darker purple,
with the exception of the portions of the alæ added during the diametric
growth, which are of a dead white, and are externally conspicuous.
The scuta are striated longitudinally. I may remark, that, excepting
the narrowness of the radii, with their quite smooth, rounded and very
oblique summits, some specimens are hardly distinguishable, in external
aspect, from varieties of <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>. If the specimens from the
north-east coast of Australia, of which I have seen many (but unfortunately
only one small one had its opercular valves), form, as I fully
believe, merely a variety; it is characterised by its nearly uniform
beautiful rosy pink, without any <em>distinct</em> longitudinal bands: of these
specimens I have seen one two inches in basal diameter, and three in
height: of ordinary duller-coloured striped specimens, the largest was
1.7 in basal diameter. Of the perfectly white <i>var.</i> (<i>b</i>), I have seen
several specimens, the largest being .6 of an inch in diameter: these
have a somewhat peculiar aspect, but I have met with only one specimen
with opercular valves, and that was extremely young: I at first
considered this form as specifically distinct; but I can point out,
after careful examination of the whole shell, operculum, and internal
animal of the young specimen, no sufficient diagnostic characters.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i>, plainly striated longitudinally, with the striæ dividing the
prominent lines of growth into squarish beads: internally, the upper
part of the valve is roughened: the articular ridge is short, remarkably
little prominent, and not reflexed; the adductor ridge is blunt and
little prominent; sometimes it is almost confluent with the articular
ridge: there is a deep but variable depression for the lateral depressor
muscle; and in young specimens of <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>) it was almost absent.
<i>Tergum</i>: the surface exhibits traces of longitudinal striæ: there is
a deep longitudinal furrow, with the sides folded in and quite closed
in full grown specimens: the scutal margin is considerably curved
towards the scutum. The spur is long and narrow, with the end
bluntly pointed, placed at rather above its own width from the basi-scutal
angle; the basal margin slopes but little towards the spur: the
crests for the depressores are feebly developed.</p>

<p><i>Parietes</i>: their internal surfaces are strongly ribbed longitudinally,
with the basal ends of the ribs coarsely denticulated, and with the
denticuli extending close to the outer lamina. The radii are generally
narrow, but their width varies; their summits are very oblique,
smooth, rounded, and inflected, with the lines of growth, in the
uppermost part, curving inwards; their sutural edges, in the upper
inflected portion, are quite smooth, without septa; in the lower and
larger portion, the edge is crenated with excessively fine teeth or septa,
not denticulated: the radii, like the parietes, have no inner lamina:
the recipient grooves in the opposed compartments are smooth, and
are in the lower part of the shell of unusual depth. The <i>alæ</i>, differently
from the radii, generally have their summits very slightly<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281" href="#Page_281"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span></a>
oblique, but sometimes they are highly oblique: their sutural edges
are most finely crenated. The <i>basis</i> is generally flat, sometimes cup-formed;
it is permeated by pores, crossed by transverse septa; and
sometimes there is an underlying cancellated layer.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with either six very small teeth, or with none. <i>Mandibles</i>
(Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f05">5</a>), with the third tooth a little thicker than the
first; fourth and fifth teeth small, but quite distinct. <i>Maxillæ</i>
(Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, fig. <a href="#p26f07">7</a>), with the inferior part forming a square step-formed
projection, bearing, one behind the other, two spines as long as the
upper pair; in a young specimen of <i>var.</i> (<i>a</i>) this step-formed projection
was absent.</p>

<p><i>Cirri</i>: first pair with the rami unequal by about four segments:
the shorter ramus has the segments very protuberant in front, thickly
clothed with strongly serrated spines; the second cirrus has segments
moderately produced; the third has them produced only in a slight
degree. The pedicels of the second and third cirri have dorsal tufts of
spines, but not a hairy plate prolonged over the thorax. The posterior
cirri have segments broader than long, bearing only two pairs of
nearly equally long spines; and between each pair there is a small
intermediate tuft. The penis has the usual basi-dorsal point.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, smooth, but with the lower part
sometimes narrowly ribbed in lines corresponding with the internal
longitudinal ribs; tinted pale peach-blossom purple, owing to the
sheath being finely so coloured; or wholly white. Radii broad, white,
square on the summit, hence orifice entire, ovate passing into rhomboidal.
The parietal portion of the carino-lateral compartments extremely
narrow, about one eighth of the width of the parietes of the
lateral compartments. Basis concave, partially imbedded in the coral.
Largest specimen .35 of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>There are some specimens in Mr. Cuming's collection which appear
to belong to this species, and are certainly very closely allied to it, but
not having the opercula, cannot be identified positively; the shell is<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282" href="#Page_282"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span></a>
flatter, with the walls strongly ribbed up to the orifice, which is more
rhomboidal: the basis is much more cup-formed and more deeply imbedded
in the coral; but these differences by themselves are by no
means sufficiently diagnostic.</p>

<p><i>Scutum</i>: the lines of growth are crenated, causing the surface to be
very obscurely striated longitudinally: the articular ridge is very
prominent, as can be best seen from the outside, and runs down the
whole length of the tergal margin with a very regular curve, and hence
differs from the articular ridge in the foregoing species. The adductor
ridge is either absent, or very indistinct, and parallel to the articular
ridge: there is a deep little pit for the lateral depressor muscle.
<i>Tergum</i> (<a href="#p07f07d">7 <i>d</i></a>), with the apex somewhat produced or beaked, and tinged
purple: external surface almost flat, without any longitudinal furrow:
scutal margin curved. Spur very short, placed quite close to the basi-scutal
angle of the valve; broad as half the valve; lower end square.
Internally, the articular ridge is prominent only in the uppermost
part of the valve: crests for the depressores very feeble.</p>

<p><i>Parietes</i>: their internal surface is very strongly ribbed longitudinally,
the ribs being coarsely denticulated at their bases, and finely fluted along
their sides. The sheath is transversely ribbed, and clothed with an
epidermis furnished with transverse rows of fine hairs. The <i>radii</i> are
of a dead white, whereas the parietes are translucent; the summits
are parallel to the basis; they are broad; the radii of the carino-lateral
compartments appear extraordinarily broad, owing to the narrowness
of the parietal portion: the sutural edges are furnished with
coarse septa, which are sinuous, irregular, and obtusely denticulated;
the interspaces are filled up solidly. The <i>alæ</i> are thin, with their
sutural edges almost smooth, and their summits oblique: in some
specimens, during the diametric growth, a mere, almost thread-like
ribbon is added to their sutural edges. <i>Basis</i> slightly cup or saucer-shaped;
moderately thick, permeated by fine pores, and generally
ribbed in lines radiating from the centre. The walls and basis adhere
together very firmly.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with six teeth: mandibles with five teeth; the three
upper teeth being sharp, narrow, and unusually prominent; the two
lower teeth minute and sharp; maxillæ without a notch. <i>Cirri</i> much
injured: first pair with one ramus apparently one third longer than
the other: segments not very protuberant: the posterior cirri have
elongated segments with five pairs of spines.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species is very distinct from all the foregoing: in
the carino-lateral compartments being so narrow, and tending, as we
may suppose, to become aborted; in the form and structure of the
whole shell, and in its habits, this species shows an affinity and passage
to the coral-inhabiting <span class="correction" title="In the original book: genus">sub-genus</span> <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a>, which has only four compartments.
There is also a close affinity to the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>. This
species is so closely allied to the following, that I at one time felt some
doubts whether they ought to have been specifically separated; it is
also probably closely allied to <a href="#Balanus_terebratus"><i>B. terebratus</i></a>, but the materials hardly
suffice for judgment: it is also related, though less obviously, to
<a href="#Balanus_vestitus"><i>B. vestitus</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">As already stated, this species comes in all essential
respects very near to the last, though differing much in
appearance; I have seen two sets of specimens, and two
sets of <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>, and there was no variability or passage
in the points in which they differed; hence I must consider
them as specifically distinct.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>Shell</i>, steeply conical, strongly but bluntly ribbed longitudinally;
coloured either all over dull reddish purple, or with the upper part only
pinkish purple: in one set of specimens, the yellow epidermis was
partially persistent. Radii narrow. Orifice small, ovate. The wall
of the carino-lateral compartment is very narrow. The internal surface
of the parietes is ribbed, but finely, and only in the lower part. The
septa, on the sutural edges of the radii, are finer than in <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>.
Basis flat, obscurely permeated by pores. The largest specimen is
.25 of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: these are longitudinally and finely striated; the basi-tergal
corner is more rounded off than in <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>, and the articular ridge is
not nearly so prominent: internally, the adductor ridge is rather more
prominent. The <i>Tergum</i> is rather broader: its apex is produced into
a minute sharp point: the scutal margin is straight; the spur is
broader, and measured from the basi-scutal angle of the valve, considerably
longer; namely, as long as half the width of the basal margin
of the spur, whereas in <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a> it is only about a quarter as long as
the basal margin of the spur: the lower edge of the spur is not here
so directly transverse to the longitudinal axis of the valve as in <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B.
allium</i></a>: the external surface is not so flat as in that species, and a
depression runs down to the basi-scutal angle of the spur.</p>

<p class="p2">Considering the difference in the shape and appearance of
the shell, with its narrow radii and small orifice; considering
the less strongly ribbed internal lamina of the parietes, the
finer septa on the sutural edges of the radii, the slight<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284" href="#Page_284"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]</span></a>
difference in outline in the scuta and terga, more especially
the greater length of the spur, I conceive I am right in
ranking this form as a distinct species, though assuredly
it is very closely allied to <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>, and even still closer to

somewhat doubtful about its specific distinctness.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell smooth, or slightly folded, steeply
conical; white, with four longitudinal bands of pale brownish-gray
colour, namely, on the rostrum, the carina, and the two lateral compartments:
the carino-lateral compartments are very narrow and almost
white: the four brownish-gray bands are darkest in the upper part of
the shell, though always rather faint, and die out towards the base:
they can sometimes be seen to be formed of several narrow longitudinal
stripes; the tint shows a trace of containing purple. The orifice of
the shell is small, rhomboidal, and not quite entire, owing to the
obliquity of the summits of the moderately broad radii. In structure,
the shell, radii, and alæ resemble those in the last species. The
basis, however, does not appear to be permeated by pores. Basal
diameter of largest specimen .25 of an inch.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> most closely resemble those of <a href="#Balanus_cepa"><i>B. cepa</i></a>, but the lines of
growth are not crenated, and internally there is only a very minute pit
for the lateral depressor muscle, placed almost on the edge itself of the
valve. The <i>Tergum</i> hardly differs at all from that of <a href="#Balanus_cepa"><i>B. cepa</i></a>, but is
perhaps of rather greater breadth.</p>

<p>The <i>Mouth</i> does not differ from that in the last two species. In the
<i>Cirri</i>, the three posterior pairs have elongated segments, bearing only<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285" href="#Page_285"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 285]</span></a>
three pairs of spines, of which the lowest pair is minute: in <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>,
and I believe in <a href="#Balanus_cepa"><i>B. cepa</i></a>, there are five pairs of spines on each
segment.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">This species differs from the last only in the peculiar
colouring, smoother walls, more oblique radii, solid basis,
and more especially in the scuta having the lines of growth
not crenated, and internally, in the pit for the lateral
depressor muscle being so very minute and placed on the
basi-tergal edge of the valve. The posterior cirri, also, I
believe, differ in the number of the spines which the
segments support; nevertheless, I cannot feel confident
about the specific distinctness of <a href="#Balanus_quadrivittatus"><i>B. quadrivittatus</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">I have in this instance broken through my rule of not
describing a Cirripede without examining the opercular
valves; but the species here named is so peculiar, that it
would have been a fault to have passed it over. There is
but a single specimen in the British Museum, without, as
just stated, the operculum, and of course without the
animal's body.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p><i>Shell</i>, white, depressed, conical, somewhat elongated in its rostro-carinal
axis; orifice rather small, pentagonal, toothed, elongated.
Parietes rather thin, with extremely prominent longitudinal ribs, produced
at the basal edge into long spikes: the internal surface is also
ribbed, but less strongly than the outside. Radii rather narrow, with
oblique, not smooth summits; sutural edges very finely and obscurely
crenated. Alæ with their summits extremely oblique. Lower edge of
sheath closely attached to the walls. The carino-lateral compartments
are rather narrow.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i>, slightly concave or saucer-shaped; the circumference is pro<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286" href="#Page_286"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span></a>duced
into long spikes, corresponding with those on the basal margin of
the parietes: these projections equal half the semi-diameter of the shell.
The internal surface of the basis has slightly prominent, rounded ridges;
and the external surface has extraordinarily prominent, sharp ridges,
radiating from the centre; the edges of the external ridges are irregular,
notched, and knobbed. I have seen in no other species external
ridges on the basis or surface of attachment; and what is more remarkable,
the interspaces between the ridges are penetrated by small
rounded apertures, of irregular shape and unequal sizes; and these are
generally arranged in an irregular double row, and externally are closed
by the membrane, which clothes the basis. In the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>,
the basal cup is sometimes penetrated by similar holes, but these seem
never to extend over the whole basis, and are very variable; nevertheless,
in some specimens of <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>Acasta spongites</i></a> from the Cape of Good
Hope, portions of the basis closely resembled, except in the absence of
the radiating ridges, the structure here described, but the holes were
not arranged in any definite order. The internal surface of the
parietes in <a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>Acasta sporillus</i></a> presents a somewhat analogous appearance,
but the pits do not penetrate through the walls. This species, I have
no doubt, is closely allied to the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>, and to <a href="#Balanus_navicula"><i>Balanus
navicula</i></a> with its allies, and, but much less closely, to <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a> with
its allies. Indeed, had <a href="#Balanus_terebratus"><i>B. terebratus</i></a> inhabited a sponge, I should
have been compelled to have ranked it in the sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shape conical, often steeply conical; orifice
small; radii not developed, represented by mere fissures. The walls
are smooth, or slightly, or strongly ribbed longitudinally. The shell
itself is of a fine peach-blossom pink, or nearly white, but it is
generally covered by a thick yellow or brownish-orange epidermis.
Opercular valves pinkish, but similarly covered. Basal diameter of
largest specimen .7 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, with the lines of growth closely approximate; surface somewhat
convex. Internally, the articular ridge is very little prominent,
but runs far down the tergal margin; in some specimens, however, it
is shorter and more prominent. The adductor ridge is strongly prominent,
is curved towards the rostral angle, and runs down nearly to<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287" href="#Page_287"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span></a>
the basal margin. The rostral depressor muscle is lodged in a small
cavity, formed, as usual, by the overlapping of the occludent margin;
within this cavity there are either tolerably distinct little crests, or
merely traces of them, for the attachment of the muscle. The lateral
depressor muscle is attached to several quite distinct crests, seated in a
concavity beneath the adductor ridge. <i>Tergum</i> rather narrow, with the
apex produced or beaked; the beak is purplish and flat. There is a
slight rounded longitudinal furrow, or depression. The spur is fully
one third of the width of the valve: it is short, with the end truncated,
and placed close to the basi-scutal angle; the basal margin on the
carinal side slopes gently towards the spur. Internally, the scutal
margin is scarcely at all inflected, and the articular ridge is very little
prominent: the crests for the tergal depressores are pretty well developed.</p>

<p>From the points here enumerated, it is clear that the opercular
valves are articulated together much less strongly than is usual with
most species, excepting <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a> and its allies. It is remarkable that
in this species the terga are united to the sheath, not, as is usual, by a
single opercular membrane, but by five or six, one above the other, the
upper membranes not having been exuviated as each new lower one
was formed. The minute spines on the membrane lining the sheath
are rather larger and more numerous than is usual, and to the base of
each spine a tubulus of unusual diameter runs, imbedded in the shell.</p>

<p>The <i>Walls</i>, internally, have unusually numerous, narrow, approximate,
strongly prominent, longitudinal ribs, denticulated at their bases,
and inserted into the furrows on the borders of the basis: in old specimens
these internal ribs die out in the upper part of the walls. The
<i>Radii</i> are not developed in any of the many specimens which I have
seen, and the edges of the compartments on both sides of each suture
are equally marked by slight, irregular ridges or knobs, answering to
the septa and their recipient furrows, in the species with ordinarily developed
radii. There is very little diametric growth, the orifice being
gradually enlarged by the disintegration of the upper ends of the walls;
the <i>alæ</i>, however, in some specimens, do grow a little along their
lateral or sutural edges, so that some little diametric growth must be
effected. The summits of the alæ are very oblique; their sutural edges
are plainly crenated. The sheath descends about half way down the
walls. The <i>Basis</i> is flat, not permeated by pores, but deeply furrowed
in lines radiating from the centre.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum sometimes with no teeth, sometimes with four
minute teeth; mandibles with four teeth, of which the third is blunt
and rather large; the fourth is a mere knob. Maxillæ; there is, as
usual, an upper pair of large spines (beneath which there is sometimes
a small notch), but all the lower spines, instead of standing as usual in
pairs, form a single row. <i>Cirri</i>; first pair with the rami remarkably
unequal in length, one ramus having twenty-two segments, and being
more than twice the length of the other, having only nine segments:
these segments, and likewise those of the second and third pairs, have
an inverted conical shape; and they are all less thickly clothed with
spines than is usual. The second pair is short, about as long as the<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288" href="#Page_288"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</span></a>
shorter ramus of the first pair, and has ten or twelve segments. The
third pair is above twice as long as the second pair, and contains
twenty-four segments: this very unusual length is owing to the presence
of numerous thin tapering upper segments, unlike those generally
found in <i><a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a></i>, in the third pair of cirri, and apparently serving
as feelers. These upper tapering segments are of an inverted conical
shape, and support on their upper margins two very small tufts of
spines, one behind and one in front: on the segments lower down these
tufts increase in size, and the spines are more spread out, so that in
the basal segments, the tufts in front form on the upper margin two
or three crowded rows of bristles. The three posterior pairs of cirri have
elongated segments, which bear on their upper half three pairs of
spines; of these the lowest pair is minute, and the middle pair is only
one third of the length of the upper pair. The sixth cirrus, in the
same individual as before, contained twenty-seven segments in each
ramus, that is only three more than in the third cirrus! I must
observe, that the cirri in all the specimens were irregular, often distorted
and monstrous; and therefore, probably, there is considerable
variation in the proportional numbers of the segments in the cirri.</p>

<p>At the base of the penis there is a minute, knife-edged, triangular
projection. The branchiæ are rather narrow, pointed, and not very
large.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This is a very distinct species, as shown by the peculiarities
in the cirri, by the absence of radii to the shell, and by the presence
of crests for the attachment of the lateral scutal depressores.
With the exception of this latter character, the opercular valves clearly
show, that <a href="#Balanus_vestitus"><i>B. vestitus</i></a> is allied to <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_cepa"><i>cepa</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_quadrivittatus"><i>quadrivittatus</i></a>.

very thick, little prominent; articular furrow very narrow, the impression
made by the adductor muscle is seated very high up the
valve; there is hardly an adductor ridge, but the surface of the valve
is angularly prominent in a curved line, running from the articular
ridge to near the rostral angle of the valve. At the rostral angle, the
occludent margin is not folded inwards, as is generally the case, but
the surface is flat, and is marked by four or five crests for the attachment
of the rostral depressor muscle. There are other crests for the

ribbed longitudinally, but in some specimens nearly smooth. The

and have their summits very oblique and jagged; exteriorly,
they are sulcated in a transverse direction, and sometimes form oblique
steps, from having been formed layer over layer: their sutural edges
are formed of irregularly branching crests or septa. The <i>alæ</i> have
their summits very oblique; their sutural edges are thick and crenated:
the part added during diametric growth on the inner surface is smooth,
and has a different appearance from the transversely ribbed portions of
the sheath, of which the alæ form a portion. The lower edge of the
sheath is hollow beneath. The carino-lateral compartments are very
narrow.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i> calcareous, thin, white, sometimes opalescent, apparently

mandibles, with the fourth and fifth teeth small and rudimentary;
maxillæ rather broad, with a narrow and rather deep notch under the
two great upper spines: outer maxillæ with the lower lobe very large.</p>

to the following, <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a>. The crests on the under side of the

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell either extremely much depressed and
irregular, or globulo-conical, or more rarely cylindrical and elongated.
Walls, either with a few rather broad, smooth, irregular, longitudinal
folds, or, in <i>var. sordidus</i>, with numerous sharper and more prominent
longitudinal ridges; basal margin very sinuous. Colour, either fine rich
peach-blossom purple, or so pale as to be almost white; or in <i>var.
sordidus</i> dirty white, generally stained greenish from confervoid matter.
Orifice small, oval, entire. Radii very narrow, white, or not at all developed,
and with even the sutures not distinguishable. The purple
coloured varieties, with the narrow white radii, the small oval orifice,
and folded walls, have a very pretty appearance, which is far from the
case with <i>var. sordidus</i>. The largest specimens attained a basal
diameter of .6 of an inch, but this is an unusual size: I have seen a
cylindrical specimen of <i>var. sordidus</i> one inch in length.</p>

<p>The opercular valves are united to the sheath by unusually strong
membrane: internally, their upper parts are stained purple. <i>Scuta</i>,
these vary considerably in breadth, some being even broader than in<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291" href="#Page_291"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span></a>
Pl. <a href="#Page_692">8</a>, fig. <a href="#p08f05c">5 <i>c</i></a>, and others as much elongated as in fig. <a href="#p08f05d">5 <i>d</i></a>: these latter
come from an elongated cylindrical shell. The valve externally is
unusually convex: the apex, also, projects freely to an unusual degree.
Internally, the articular ridge is moderately prominent: the adductor
ridge is prominent and much curved: in the upper part it either lies
close to, or at some little distance from the articular ridge. The lateral
depressores are attached to several little crests, occupying a cavity,
(often bordered above by a little ridge) close beneath the adductor
ridge. <i>Tergum</i>, extraordinarily narrow and elongated; beak triangular,
purple: a longitudinal furrow runs down the valve: spur narrow,
long, bluntly pointed, lying close to the basi-scutal angle of the
valve: the scutal margin is nearly straight and parallel to the spur.
Internally, the articular ridge is prominent: the crests for the depressores
are moderately well developed: the upper part of the valve is
marked by a purple patch, bounded on one side by the articular ridge,
and on the other side by a very slight special ridge. There is some
variability in the narrowness of the whole valve, and in the sharpness of
the spur.</p>

<p><i>Parietes.</i>—The under surface, in the more depressed varieties, is
roughened in a remarkable manner nearly or quite up to the sheath,
with very irregular, projecting, and branching ridges, and sometimes
with depending points. These ridges and points are granulated on
their under surfaces. The roughened surface in the more conical varieties
is confined to the basal inner margin. This structure is nearly the
same as that in <a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>B. imperator</i></a>, represented (Pl. <a href="#Page_692">8</a>, fig. <a href="#p08f04c">4 <i>c</i></a>), but the little
ridges are here more apt to be concentric, instead of radiating. The
lateral edges of the compartments on the inside, especially the carinal
edges, project inwards beyond the inner surface of the shell. The sheath
is but little hollow on its under side. The diametric growth of the shell
seems to be quite capricious; in the same group, some individuals thus
increasing, and others not at all. When the radii are developed they are
narrow and white, with their upper margins nearly if not quite parallel
to the basis: their sutural edges are formed by large, irregular, branching
teeth or septa. The <i>alæ</i>, also, have their sutural edges coarsely
crenated; and when the shell increases by diametric growth, they are
added to above the opercular membrane, so as to be nearly square at top.</p>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—When a shell is removed from the surface of attachment,
and inspected even under a lens, there appears to be no basis whatever,
either adhering to the shell, or to the supporting surface: but when a
more careful examination is made, with a higher power, an excessively
thin, translucent, calcareous, irregular layer, or rather film, can almost
always be discovered. This would be more easily distinguished if the
specimens had adhered to rock instead of to the rugged shells of molluscs.
At one time I thought the basis was partially membranous, for I
have certainly scraped off small fragments of membrane from the supporting
surface; but these, when examined under the compound
microscope, seemed always to consist of a thin sheet of the yellow
cementing tissue; and in some instances, a brittle film of shell, representing
the true basis of the cirripede, still adhered to the upper surface
of the membranous bits of cement. Nevertheless, so imperfect is the<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292" href="#Page_292"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</span></a>
calcareous basis, that I should not be surprised if portions of a true
membranous basis did really in some cases exist.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum with the notch wide, generally with a few little
teeth; mandibles with three teeth, and some inferior knobs; maxillæ
notched. <i>Cirri</i>, first pair with one ramus shorter by three segments
than the other ramus. Second and third pairs short, of nearly equal
length, thickly clothed with spines; segments very little protuberant.
Posterior cirri, having elongated segments, supporting seven pairs of
spines.</p>

<p><i>Var. sordidus.</i>—This form is very common on the tidal shores of the
Strait of Magellan, and of the southernmost parts of Tierra del Fuego,
near Cape Horn: it lives attached to rocks, mytili, and logs of wood,
and is associated with <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>Chthamalus scabrosus</i></a>. It almost certainly is
the most antarctic form of the genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. If I were guided by
external appearance alone, I should certainly separate this form specifically
from <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a>, but, as will be seen in the following description,
the differences consist only in <i>var. sordidus</i> being much duller and
rather differently coloured, in the longitudinal folds being sharper and
more prominent, and in the whole shell being rather more globular,
and on an average rather larger; but in the true <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a> there is
considerable variation in all these respects, as there likewise is in
<i>var. sordidus</i>; thus some of the cylindrical varieties of the latter
have less prominent ridges than even <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: var. flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></span></a>. In general appearance
I have seen some <em>nearly</em>, but not exactly, intermediate
forms; therefore, I do not feel positive that these forms may not be
specifically distinct, but have failed, after careful examination, to find
any sufficient diagnostic <em>characters</em>. Moreover, in the case of <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>Balanus
lævis</i></a>, I was led to believe that there is an equal and somewhat
analogous amount of variation in the specimens inhabiting Tierra del
Fuego and northern Chile; and in this case I was enabled to show the
existence of strictly intermediate forms in the intermediate districts.</p>

<p>The shell in <i>var. sordidus</i> is generally globulo-conical, dirty white,
frequently with a green tinge, from the growth of confervoid matter.
Orifice small. The exterior surface is covered with numerous prominent,
narrow, sharp ribs or folds, the basal margin being serrated
with projecting points where the folds terminate. When the radii are
not developed, the sutures are very often obscure. Internally, the shell
is faintly tinted of a port-wine purple. In all points of structure this
form is identical with the true <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a>. In some few specimens
the whole exterior surface was disintegrated and smooth; and this is
generally the case with the upper parts of the shell. Some other
specimens, which had grown crowded together on wood, had become
cylindrical, and consequently the orifice was as large in diameter as
the shell, namely, half an inch: in some of these cylindrical varieties
the sheath was entirely soldered to the walls. The largest specimens
which I have seen were .6 of an inch in diameter; and above one inch
in height.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species, in its opercular valves, even in such trifling
characters as the strength of the opercular membrane, and in its cirri,
approaches closely to <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a>. We even see on the under side of<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293" href="#Page_293"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 293]</span></a>
the scutum, in that species, a single little ridge, foreshadowing, as it
were, the crests for the lateral scutal depressores, so remarkable in our
present species. In the structure of the shell and of the basis, <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a>
is much more closely related to the last species, or <a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>B. imperator</i></a>.
If it had been possible to have arranged the species in a single line,
<a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>B. flosculus</i></a> ought undoubtedly to have been placed between <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a>
and <a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>imperator</i></a>.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical or tubulo-conical, often rather
globose; walls frequently thin, either very smooth, or deeply plicated
longitudinally: occasionally the same specimen is smooth in the upper
part, and strongly plicated in the lower. The Radii in the larger specimens
are wide, and with their upper margins only slightly oblique; in
the smaller, they are narrower and much more oblique, but in each case
their upper margins are smooth and slightly bowed. Colour apparently
originally nearly white, but with the alæ generally, in the smaller
specimens, clouded with a dark tint: the radii are usually striped
feebly in longitudinal lines. Basal diameter of largest specimen .8 of
an inch; but this seems to have been an unusual size.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: narrow, with the basal margin forming an unusually small
angle with the occludent margin; surface slightly convex, with lines<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294" href="#Page_294"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span></a>
of growth approximate, moderately prominent; on the tergal half of
the valve, two distinct rather broad furrows, with sometimes a third,
and even a fourth, nearer to the occludent margin (Pl. <a href="#Page_692">8</a>, fig. <a href="#p08f06a">6 <i>a</i></a>),
extend from the apex down the valve, and give it a very peculiar
appearance: the furrows near the tergal margin are the deepest.
Internally, the upper part of the valve is roughened with small
points: the articular furrow is unusually wide: the articular ridge is
very prominent and but little reflexed, with the lower end almost
abruptly cut off: the adductor ridge is prominent, but short: there are
small deepish pits for the rostral and lateral depressores.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i> (<a href="#p08f06b">6 <i>b</i></a>), broad, flat, with a slight narrow prominent rim
along the scutal margin, which margin is slightly bowed. The basal
margin on the carinal side of the spur slopes so gradually towards
the spur, that the latter is barely distinct, and is very short, not
depending nearly half its own width beneath the basi-scutal angle:
it is broad, namely, measured across the upper part, as broad as
half the valve; its basal end is obliquely rounded off on the carinal
side; it is placed close to the basi-scutal angle. The carinal margin
of the valve is just perceptibly bowed, and is formed by rectangularly
upturned lines of growth. Internally, the upper part of the valve is
rough; the articular ridge is prominent; the crests for the tergal
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: depressores">depressor</span> muscles are moderately well-developed.</p>

<p><i>Parietes</i>, not porose; internally, the ribs are smooth, with their basal
edges very finely or barely denticulated. The <i>radii</i> (as already stated)
are of variable breadth; they have their upper margins either very
slightly or highly oblique, but always smooth and rounded: their
sutural edges are quite smooth, or sometimes, with a strong lens, traces
of transverse striæ, representing septa, can just be discovered. The
<i>alæ</i> have their upper margins very oblique; their sutural edges are, in
the large specimens, quite smooth; in the younger ones, plainly
crenated; the recipient furrow being clearly marked with these teeth.
<i>Basis</i> plainly porose.</p>

<p><i>Varieties.</i>—It is certain that there are longitudinally plicated specimens
of this species, and that the obliquity of the upper margins of
the radii also varies a little: nevertheless some of the deeply plicated
specimens undoubtedly have a very different aspect from the ordinary
varieties, and do really differ in the sutural edges of the alæ being
crenated, and in the greater narrowness and obliquity of the radii; but
these points are all commonly variable. I have not seen any large
specimens of the variety, <i>plicatus</i>, so as to compare them with the large
specimens of the normal form, yet I can hardly entertain any doubt,
considering their agreement in so many important points, that I have
rightly treated these forms as mere varieties; it is unfortunate that none
of the specimens of the <i>var. plicatus</i> seen by me have had opercular
valves, as their presence would have removed all shadow of doubt.</p>

<p><i>Affinities</i>: this is a strongly characterised species, and nearly allied
only to the following species, <a href="#Balanus_dolosus"><i>B. dolosus</i></a>. The furrows on the scuta in
some degree resemble those on <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a>, but there is no alliance
with that species. It is certain that amongst recent species, the chief
affinity is with <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_amaryllis"><i>amaryllis</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">This species so closely resembles <a href="#Balanus_bisulcatus"><i>B. bisulcatus</i></a>, both
externally and in all the essential characters of the parietes,
radii, and basis, that it is quite superfluous to describe
over again these parts. The specific characters are derived
from the opercular valves, which present well defined distinctions,
found by me constant in several specimens of both
species. <a href="#Balanus_dolosus"><i>B. dolosus</i></a>, like <a href="#Balanus_bisulcatus"><i>B. bisulcatus</i></a>, has quite smooth
and deeply plicated varieties, often adhering to the same
univalve. The ribs on the inner surfaces of the parietes
are remarkably prominent. I think the upper margins of
the radii are in this species rather more oblique than in
<a href="#Balanus_bisulcatus"><i>B. bisulcatus</i></a>. The sutural edges of the radii are marked
by the finest striæ, representing septa. The sutural edges
of the alæ are generally distinctly crenated. The basis is
often slightly cup-formed, and very plainly porose: its
surface is marked by radiating ridges. The orifice of the
shell is large, and elongated, especially in young specimens.
The basal diameter of the largest specimen is .4 of an inch.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2">The <i>Scuta</i> have no trace of the two or three longitudinal furrows so
conspicuous on these valves in <a href="#Balanus_bisulcatus"><i>B. bisulcatus</i></a>, and which, in that species,
run down from the apex of the valve; this fact showing that the furrows
occur in quite young individuals. The whole valve is not quite so narrow
as in <a href="#Balanus_bisulcatus"><i>B. bisulcatus</i></a>, but otherwise agrees with it in shape: internally,
there is hardly any difference: the articular furrow is not so wide: the
articular ridge is very prominent, and abruptly truncated at its lower
end: the adductor ridge is also prominent; it here runs a little higher up
the valve than in <a href="#Balanus_bisulcatus"><i>B. bisulcatus</i></a>. The <i>Tergum</i> differs more in the two
species: the spur is not so broad; measured in its upper part, it is
only about one third of the entire width of the valve, instead of being<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296" href="#Page_296"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 296]</span></a>
half as wide as the valve: it is considerably longer, depending beneath
the basi-scutal angle more than half its own width: the basal margin
of the valve on the carinal side, does not slope so gradually into the
spur: the occludent and carinal margins are slightly arched, as in
<a href="#Balanus_bisulcatus"><i>B. bisulcatus</i></a>. Internally, the surface is rough, the articular ridge is
prominent, and the crests for the tergal depressores are well developed,—all
as in <a href="#Balanus_bisulcatus"><i>B. bisulcatus</i></a>. It is remarkable, how generally the opercular
valves have been preserved in this species in its fossil condition, as
compared with most other species of the genus.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">It is not easy to distinguish by external characters the
rugged varieties of this species from <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>; indeed,
the only difference is that the furrows receiving the edges of
the radii, generally, exhibit in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> a slight impression
of the septa, which are entirely absent in <a href="#Balanus_dolosus"><i>B. dolosus</i></a>.
By internal characters, such as the non-porose parietes, and
porose basis, our present species widely differs from <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B.
crenatus</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">This species, the most ancient one as yet well known
in the genus, presents to the systematist a most unfortunate
peculiarity, in the parietes being almost as
often as not permeated by small pores: I have seen no
other instance, except to a limited degree in <a href="#Balanus_glandula"><i>B. glandula</i></a>,
of this character being variable, and hence it must be still
considered of high classificatory value, in so varying genus
as <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. Owing to this varying condition of the
parietes, together with the basis being quite solid, our
present species has as good a claim to be ranked in the last
as in the present section; indeed, I think it has more
affinity to <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_glandula"><i>glandula</i></a> in the last section, than
to any other recent forms: I have placed it in its present
place, owing to its intimate affinity to <a href="#Balanus_varians"><i>B. varians</i></a>, in which
the parietes seem always to be solid; and partly, I believe,
because all the first specimens examined by me exhibited
no traces of parietal pores. Owing to the kindness of
Mr. F. Edwards, I have seen the original specimens, excellently
figured by Mr. J. de C. Sowerby in the 'Mineral
Conchology:' I can perceive no difference between <a href="#Balanus_unguiformis"><i>B. unguiformis</i></a>
and <i>erisma</i>, excepting that the walls in the latter
are longitudinally folded,—a character we know to be variable
in so many species. In both <span class="correction" title="In the original book: varietes">varieties</span>, the parietes are
sometimes porose and sometimes solid. The smaller specimens,
however, figured in the 'Mineral Conchology' to the
right hand, may possibly be a distinct species, as I infer
from the narrowness of their radii.</p>

the articular ridge is very prominent, and slightly reflexed: there is no
distinct adductor ridge; there is a slight but variable depression for
the lateral depressor. <i>Tergum</i>, with the longitudinal furrow shallow;
spur moderately long, about one fourth or one fifth of the width of the<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298" href="#Page_298"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span></a>
valve; placed at about its own width from the basi-scutal angle; basal
end bluntly pointed; the basal margin on the opposite sides of the
spur forms a nearly straight line; the carinal margin has an extremely
narrow border formed by upturned lines of growth. Internally, the
surface is roughened with little points: the articular ridge is prominent:
the crests for the tergal depressores moderately prominent.</p>

<p><i>Parietes</i>: the longitudinal ribs on the internal surface are either
feebly, or, in the lower part, strongly developed; their basal ends are
only just perceptibly denticulated. As already stated, in about half
the specimens, there were no traces of parietal pores; in the other
half there were either distinct or obscure pores; the pores are circular,
generally of unequal sizes, and never large; in the same individual
they would sometimes be almost wholly absent in some of the compartments,
and quite plain in the other compartments. The Radii are
either moderately wide or rather narrow, and have their upper margins
very oblique, and not distinctly arched, and not quite smooth: their
sutural edges are very finely crenated, the teeth or septa not being
denticulated. The upper margins of the <i>alæ</i> are rather less oblique
than those of the radii: their sutural edges are barely crenated. The
<i>basis</i> is thin, and without any trace of pores; the upper surface is sometimes
furrowed in radiating lines.</p>

the whole shell is stronger, and the basis can be seen to be

<p class="p2">My materials consist of a beautiful series of specimens in
Messrs. Wood and Bowerbank's collections; but unfortunately
only a single young specimen had its opercular
valves preserved. Not one specimen of the very curious
variety (<i>a</i>) had opercular valves, yet I cannot feel any doubt
about its being only a variety, caused by its attachment
to a thin cylindrical branch of a coral, instead of to a
foliaceous Bryozoon; it will, however, be convenient to give
a separate description of this very remarkable form. With
respect to var. (<i>b</i>), both sets of specimens came to me
with the name <i>B. stellaris</i>, of Bronn; but as Bronn distinctly
states, that in his species the parietes are porose, and
as such is not here the case, this cannot possibly be that
species: these specimens did not possess their opercular
valves, and therefore cannot be identified with certainty.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, with the orifice rather large,
and rhomboidal. The surface is very smooth, except in var. (<i>b.</i>) from
the Continent, in which it is rugged and longitudinally folded. The
colour is ochreous-brown (chiefly no doubt derived from the imbedding
substance) tinged with red. The radii often have a much darker and
more distinct red tint; they are sometimes longitudinally striped with
dirty white. The radii are broad, with their summits straight, and very
slightly oblique; in <i>var. b</i>, however, they slope at an angle of about
45°. Basal diameter of largest specimens .6 of an inch; but this is
an unusual size.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i> (from a young individual), with the growth ridges little
prominent. Internally the articular ridge is moderately prominent,
with its lower end very obliquely rounded off; there is no adductor
ridge; there is a minute pit for the lateral depressor muscle. <i>Terga</i>,
with a slight longitudinal depression extending down to the spur: spur
short, with its lower end almost square or truncated, about one fourth of
width of valve, and placed at about half its own width from the basi-scutal
angle. Internally, the articular ridge is prominent; the crests
for the tergal depressores are feebly developed.</p>

<p><i>Parietes</i>, moderately thick and generally strongly ribbed internally,
without <span class="correction" title="Darwin's errata changed from: parieted">parietal</span> pores. <i>Radii</i>, wide, with their upper margins
straight, not smooth or rounded, and very slightly (or, in <i>var. b</i>
moderately) oblique; their sutural edges have well-developed septa,
which are denticulated: the interspaces between the septa are filled
up solidly. The <i>alæ</i> have their upper margins oblique: they are only
slightly, and sometimes not at all, added to above the level of the opercular
membrane: their sutural edges are smooth. The <i>basis</i> is thin,
but plainly porose.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (<i>a</i>).—With respect to this remarkable variety, any one would at
first think it specifically distinct. The shell is much compressed, or elon<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301" href="#Page_301"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span></a>gated
in the rostro-carinal axis, sometimes to a great degree; I have
seen a specimen .25 of an inch in this axis and only .1 in its broadest
part; but this is a very unusual degree of elongation. The most
remarkable character is the extraordinary narrowness of the carina, the
carino-lateral compartments, and of the rostrum, compared with the
great breadth, especially along the basal margin (Pl. <a href="#Page_692">8</a>, fig. <a href="#p08f10b">10 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p08f10c">10 <i>c</i></a>),
of the lateral compartments. The radii are of unusual breadth. The
tips of the rostrum and of the lateral compartments are a little arched
in, tending to make the shell somewhat globular. The true basis is
extremely narrow (fig. <a href="#p08f10c">10 <i>c</i></a>): it is deeply grooved, from clasping the
thin, cylindrical stem of the coral to which it had adhered; and I have
seen specimens in which the opposite edges of the groove had met, a
tube having been thus actually formed. From the grooved basis, and
from the elongation of the shell in the rostro-carinal axis, this species
presents so close a general resemblance to <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>Balanus calceolus</i></a>, and its
allies, that I have seen it in a collection arranged on the same tablet
with a fossil specimen of <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a>. Notwithstanding the above
several strongly-marked characters, by which this variety differs from
the ordinary form, there is a resemblance in colour and aspect, which
though difficult to be described, made me from the first suspect that the
two were specifically identical. In no point of real structure is there
any difference, excepting that, perhaps, the pores in the basis are here
rather smaller; but this might arise from the little development of the
peculiar basis. Having come to this conclusion, I was interested by
finding a specimen in Mr. Wood's collection, which had originally
fixed itself (judging from the form of the basis) on a cylindrical stem,
but which had subsequently grown on to an adjoining flat surface;
consequently, one side of the shell presented all the peculiar characters
of the present variety, whereas the other side, at the rostral end, was
undistinguishable from the ordinary form. The unequal development
of the rostrum on the two sides was very striking, and clearly showed
how great an effect could be produced by the nature of the surface of
attachment.</p>

<p>This singular variety cannot be considered accidental, in the sense in
which this term may be applied to some varieties: the larva evidently
fixes itself intentionally, in a certain definite position, on the branch of
the coral (when a branch is chosen), exactly as in the case of <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>Balanus
calceolus</i></a>, or <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>. But when other species of Balani
occasionally fix themselves on branched corals, their position seems to
be accidental and unsymmetrical; thus among the symmetrically elongated
specimens of the present species, I found one specimen of <a href="#Balanus_bisulcatus"><i>Balanus
bisulcatus</i></a>, which had evidently been attached in an almost transverse
position to a branch, and had thus become much distorted; so, again,
I have seen specimens of the recent <a href="#Balanus_amaryllis"><i>B. amaryllis</i></a> attached irregularly
to a Gorgonia, in the midst of the symmetrically elongated shells of
<a href="#Balanus_navicula"><i>Balanus navicula</i></a>, an ally of <a href="#Balanus_calceolus"><i>B. calceolus</i></a>.</p>

<p>This variety does not seem to attain so large a size as the ordinary
form.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species is allied to the two last described fossils,
namely, <a href="#Balanus_varians"><i>B. varians</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_unguiformis"><i>unguiformis</i></a>, but is perhaps more nearly related<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302" href="#Page_302"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 302]</span></a>
to the recent <a href="#Balanus_allium"><i>B. allium</i></a>, an inhabitant of the Barrier Reef of Australia.
The longitudinally folded variety (<i>b</i>) can hardly be distinguished by external
aspect, or even by the opercular valves, from <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>; but
when the shell is disarticulated, the porose walls and non-porose basis
of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>, allow of no mistake in the diagnosis of the two species.</p>

<div class="habitat">

<p class="p2">Distribution mundane; imbedded in sponges and the sponge-like bark of
Isis.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">This sub-genus, in one sense, is a very natural one, inasmuch
as all the species are closely allied in essential structure,
in general appearance, and in habit. On the other
hand, in the structure of the shell, in all the characters
derived from the opercular valves and animal's body,
<a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> cannot properly be distinguished generically from
some species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>; thus <a href="#Balanus_navicula"><i>B. navicula</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_cymbiformis"><i>cymbiformis</i></a>
agree in the parietes and basis not being porose and in all
other essential respects, differing only in the shell being more
elongated in the rostro-carinal axis and in being attached
to Gorgoniæ instead of to sponges; yet we shall see that
<a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>Acasta purpurata</i></a> lives imbedded in the bark of Isis, so
that even the habit of being imbedded in sponges fails.
<a href="#Balanus_terebratus"><i>Balanus terebratus</i></a> would have been ranked as an <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> had
it inhabited sponges. On the other hand, some species of
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> inhabit sponges, as is often the case with <a href="#Balanus_spongicola"><i>B. spongicola</i></a>,
and always with <a href="#Balanus_declivis"><i>B. declivis</i></a>: but both these species
are distinguished easily from <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>, the former by its porose
walls and basis, and the latter by its membranous basis;
it may, however, be reasonably doubted whether such differences
ought to be considered as even sub-generic. The
most important character of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> probably consists in the
anterior ramus of the fourth pair of cirri, differing slightly<a name="Page_303" id="Page_303" href="#Page_303"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 303]</span></a>
in the arrangement of its spines, and in some other points,
from the rami of the two posterior pairs of cirri,—a
character not as yet observed in any other cirripede.
Had not the genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> been already founded and
extensively admitted, certainly I should not have formed it;
but considering the close similarity in habits, aspect, and
structure, of the nine species of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>, and considering the
already large size of the genus <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, I hope I may stand
excused for admitting <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> as a sub-genus.</p>

<p><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shape varies from nearly
globular to that of a somewhat flattened acorn, the orifice
being often a little contracted from the inward curvature
of the tips of the parietes. In <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, however, the
orifice is generally widely open; and, on the other hand, in
<a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>A. sporillus</i></a>, the orifice is reduced to a mere pore. The
usual tint is pale reddish, but <a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>A. purpurata</i></a> is purple,
and <a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>A. sporillus</i></a> purplish-brown. The surface is either
smooth, or is shagreened with minute points, as in <a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>A.
sporillus</i></a>, and <a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>fenestrata</i></a>, and in some specimens of <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A.
sulcata</i></a>; and in all the species, except <a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>A. sporillus</i></a> and
<a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>fenestrata</i></a>, many individuals are furnished with elongated,
curved, sharp, shelly points, like those in <i>var. spinosus</i> of
<a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>. The summits of the radii, which
are generally of moderate breadth, are more or less oblique;
their surface is often marked by lines parallel to the basis,
instead of by vertical lines corresponding with the lines of
growth, as in most species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The carino-lateral
compartments vary in proportional breadth in the different
species: in <a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>A. sporillus</i></a>, they tend to become rudimentary,
and in this species (Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f09b">9 <i>b</i></a>) their basal margins, or
rather points, do not reach down to the basis. The species
are all small, <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a> and <a href="#Acasta_undulata"><i>undulata</i></a> are the largest, being
sometimes .55 of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves.</i>—These differ in no generic respect
from those of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The <i>Scuta</i> are striated longitudinally
in several of the species: the adductor ridge
is barely developed in any, being most prominent in
<a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>A. cyathus</i></a>. The articular ridge is prominent in <a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>A. fenestrata</i></a>
and <a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>purpurata</i></a>. In the <i>Terga</i>, the spur is either
truncated and very broad, or moderately narrow and bluntly
pointed: the surface of the valve is often depressed, and in<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304" href="#Page_304"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 304]</span></a>
<a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a> and <a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>fenestrata</i></a> it is furrowed in the line of the
spur. The articular ridge and furrow are well developed in
<a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>A. fenestrata</i></a> and <a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>purpurata</i></a>. The crests for the tergal
depressor muscles are either absent or very feebly developed.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Parietes and Radii.</i>—The parietes are
not porose; internally, they are either smooth, or slightly,
or strongly ribbed in longitudinal lines; the presence of
these ribs, which are homologous with the parietal septa
in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, is variable even in the same species. In
<a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>A. sporillus</i></a> the inner surface is curiously reticulated. The
sutural edges of the radii are either smooth, or very slightly
crenated by the septa, in lines parallel to the basis. The
upper margins of both radii and alæ are always more or less
oblique. The radii sometimes do not extend down to the
basis; and in this case, as will presently be described,
apertures are left in the lower half, between the compartments.
In <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a> and <a href="#Acasta_laevigata"><i>lævigata</i></a> the internal margin of the
wall of each compartment, from the sheath to the basis,
projects inwards, forming inside the shell as many double
ridges (Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>), as there are compartments, namely,
six: a nearly analogous structure occurs in certain species
of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The basal edge of the sheath, in most of the
species (<a href="#p09f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p09f09b">9 <i>b</i></a>), depends freely, and is hollow beneath, but
this is always a variable point.</p>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—The base is either saucer or cup-shaped, but in
<a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>A. cyathus</i></a> it is almost flat; it is generally symmetrical and
smooth, with the lines of growth closely approximate. In
<a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>A. fenestrata</i></a> the basis is commonly as deep, as the shell is
high. The edge, in several of the species, is crenated with
minute teeth or notches; and these are so large in some specimens
of <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a> and <a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>cyathus</i></a>, as to make the edge almost
pectinated. In <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>, and in a lesser degree in <a href="#Acasta_laevigata"><i>A. lævigata</i></a>,
there are six knob-like teeth (fig. <a href="#p09f05a">5 <i>a</i></a>), corresponding with
the points of junction, between the basal edges of the inwardly
prominent margins of the six compartments, and
the basis: in those specimens, in which the six teeth are
largely developed, six ridges produced by their successive
development, extend down towards the centre of the basal
cup. When the basal cup is dissolved in acid, there is
but a little animalised tissue and an external membrane,
formed as usual in slips, and furnished with blunt<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305" href="#Page_305"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span></a>
little external points (apparently representing spines), each
of which has a short tubulus extending to the corium.
Although I dissolved the basis of three specimens, I could
not distinctly make out any cement; nor did I see any
cement-ducts; yet these are readily distinguished, after the
dissolution of the basis in acid, in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a> and
<a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>. There can be no doubt that the young shell
must at first be cemented to a fibre of the sponge; but I
suspect that the cementing-tissue is not subsequently formed,
owing to the support afforded by the growth of the enveloping
sponge. As some species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> are habitually
or occasionally imbedded in sponges, it is important to
observe, that the species of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> are not only imbedded,
but are attached to the fibres of the sponge: but even this
character, as we have already seen, is not sufficient to distinguish
the genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> from <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, for <a href="#Balanus_declivis"><i>B. declivis</i></a> is
attached exclusively to sponge.</p>

<p><i>Perforations in the Shell.</i>—Calcification seems often to
fail to a certain extent in this genus: the basal cup in most
specimens of <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, and in some of <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a> and
other species, is irregularly perforated by numerous minute
orifices, closed only by the external membrane, and filled
up inside by pulpy corium. In some specimens of
<a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, from the Cape of Good Hope, parts of the
basis were riddled like a sieve. I have seen similar perforations
in the parietes of a few specimens of <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>. In
some specimens of <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a>, the radii do not extend quite
down to the basal edge of the walls (Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>), and in
consequence a small cleft, closed only by membrane, is left
between the compartments, for a little space above the basal
cup. In <a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>A. fenestrata</i></a> (fig. <a href="#p09f07a">7 <i>a</i></a>), and in a lesser degree in
<a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>A. purpurata</i></a> (<a href="#p09f08a">8 <i>a</i></a>), not only do the radii not extend to the
basal cup, but the parietes either on one or both sides of
each suture are hollowed out, so that six, large or small,
elongated, membrane-covered openings are formed, which
extend from beneath the sheath down to the basal cup.
These openings, which I have not seen in any other genus,
will be more fully described under the respective species.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The parts of the mouth are identical in the
several species, and present no generic differences from<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306" href="#Page_306"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 306]</span></a>
those in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The outer maxillæ and palpi appear
unusually prominent: the labrum is deeply notched, with
no teeth, or very obscure teeth on each side. The mandibles
have five teeth, but the fifth is sometimes confluent with the
inferior angle. The maxillæ are not notched; and carry one
or two spines, near their inferior angle, nearly as large as the
upper pair. The outer maxillæ are bilobed.</p>

<p><i>Cirri</i>: in the first pair, the rami are very unequal in
length, the one ramus being from half to one-third of the
length of the other. The segments in the second and third
pairs, are not so much broader, or so much more crowded with
bristles, in comparison with the three posterior pairs, as is
the case with most species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The three posterior
pairs, except in <a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>A. purpurata</i></a>, are much elongated, and the
long thin segments bear four, and sometimes only three,
pairs of spines, which are generally doubly and finely
serrated, or even feathered. The most remarkable fact
respecting the cirri, is, that in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>sulcata</i></a>, <a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>cyathus</i></a>,
and <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>glans</i></a>, the fourth pair, instead of being identical in
structure, as in all other genera, with the fifth and sixth pairs,
has, on its anterior ramus, the pairs of spines more crowded
together, with the little intermediate spines, and those in
the dorsal tufts, a little longer than in the sixth cirrus; and
between the pairs of spines, there occur some straight, upwardly
pointed, very minute, and very thick spines or teeth.
And, what is still more remarkable (as will hereafter be
described in detail), in certain specimens, but not in all, of
<a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a>, the front surfaces of the lower segments on the
anterior ramus, are developed into thick, small, downwardly
curved, hook-like teeth; this likewise is the case with the
upper segment of the pedicel (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f02">2</a>),—a most
elegant, mandible-like organ for the prehension of prey being
thus formed. The variability of such beautifully contrived
teeth is very surprising. Some similar teeth occur on the
segments of the anterior ramus of the fourth cirrus, but not
on the pedicel, in <a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>A. cyathus</i></a>. A few teeth resembling the
above, but thicker, occur on the segments of the anterior
ramus of the same cirrus, in <a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>A. purpurata</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ, &amp;c.</i>—In <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, I found the branchiæ
rather small, with transverse plications. The muscles of the<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307" href="#Page_307"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 307]</span></a>
sack, which run to the opercular valves, seemed rather feeble
in most of the species. The penis in several species was
remarkably long, and in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a> I noticed the straight
projecting point at its dorsal base, as is common in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>.</p>

<p><i>Affinities, &amp;c.</i>—At the commencement of the description
of the genus, I gave my reasons for keeping <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> distinct
as a sub-genus from <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The species are particularly
troublesome to identify, not only from the great
variability of the most obvious characters, but from the very
close general external appearance of most of the species, and
the consequent necessity for cleaning and disarticulating at
least one specimen in every group. The shape, however, of
the shell and basis, and the state of their disarticulated edges,
whether smooth, crenated, or toothed, here offer more serviceable,
though still very variable, characters for the identification
of the species, than is usual with sessile cirripedes;
and this, probably, is in part due to the almost free or unattached
condition of the whole shell, suspended, as it were,
in the midst of sponges, which they inhabit. The opercular
valves, on the other hand, are less serviceable than usual.</p>

<p><i>Range, Habitats, &amp;c.</i>—The species are found all over the
world, excepting in the very cold latitudes.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[102]</span></a> <a href="#Acasta_laevigata"><i>Acasta
lævigata</i></a> ranges from the Red Sea to the Philippines;
<a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a> from the south of England and Wales to the
Cape of Good Hope; and <a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>A. cyathus</i></a> from Madeira to the
West Indies; most of the other species seem to have rather
confined ranges. The East Indian Archipelago seems to
be the metropolis of the genus, for here <a href="#Acasta_laevigata"><i>A. lævigata</i></a>,
<a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>fenestrata</i></a>, <a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>purpurata</i></a>, and <a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>sporillus</i></a>, are all found. Of these
four species, <a href="#Acasta_purpurata"><i>A. purpurata</i></a> lives imbedded, not in sponges,
but in the sponge-like bark of an Isis; and I think it probable,
that <a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>A. sporillus</i></a> may have somewhat analogous
habits. The same species often lives imbedded in different
kinds of sponge; thus, I have seen <a href="#Acasta_laevigata"><i>A. lævigata</i></a> and <a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>cyathus</i></a>
in apparently three kinds, and <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a> in, as I believe,
four kinds. The genus existed during the miocene period, in
the Coralline Crag, under a form closely allied to <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>.</p>

much doubt and trouble. At first I took the view here
adopted, namely, that they were distinct: more careful
examination made me run them altogether under one name.
Finally, after still further deliberation, and the examination
of a few additional specimens, I concluded there was
the least chance of error in classing them separately. I
may here mention, that in some sponge from the Cape
of Good Hope, this species was mingled with <a href="#Balanus_spongicola"><i>Balanus

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shape is usually that of a cup, the orifice
being, in most cases, rather large, and deeply notched, owing to the
great obliquity of the radii and alæ. The surface is generally smooth,
but furnished with sharp calcareous projections. The colour is
pinkish, and chiefly in the upper part of the shell; the lower part is
often yellowish from the preserved epidermis. The parietes in the
carino-lateral compartments are always narrow, being only one sixth or
one seventh of the width of the parietes in the lateral compartments.
The radii are not very wide, never equalling in width the parietes.
The basis is moderately deep, and sometimes very deep, being even occasionally
curled like a horn on one side. The specimens from Lisbon and
Naples are a little larger than any British specimen which I have
seen; the former being .3 of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: these are striated longitudinally in close lines, generally
plainly, but to a variable degree. The whole valve is flat, thin, and rather
elongated, with barely a trace of an adductor ridge: the articular
ridge is short and rather prominent: it terminates downwards abruptly,
and this does not appear to be the case in the two following species.
<i>Terga</i>: these are small compared with the scuta, they are slightly
beaked: the spur is truncated but rounded, more especially on the
carinal side; it is rather more than one third of the width of the
whole valve. The articular ridge and crests for the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: depressores">depressor</span> muscles
are feebly developed.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Parietes and Radii.</i>—The state of the inner surface
of the parietes varies much; generally they are slightly ribbed close to
the basis, the ribs sometimes extending up to the sheath; rarely the
surface is quite smooth. The edges of the radii are slightly crenated.
The upper internal surfaces of the radii, where overlying the alæ, are
usually marked by feeble undulating lines, nearly parallel to the basis.
The alæ have very oblique summits.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i>: this is generally of a regular cup-like form, and about two
thirds as deep as the shell is high; sometimes it is pointed at the
bottom and distorted. The edge is feebly crenated, and rarely quite
smooth. It is often penetrated by small rounded irregular holes; and
I have seen specimens from the Cape of Good Hope with parts like a
sieve.</p>

<p><i>Cirri</i>: in the first pair, the anterior ramus is nearly thrice as long as
the posterior ramus. The second cirrus is short, with one ramus
longer by three or four segments than the other ramus; the terminal
segments are truncated. The third cirrus is about one third longer
than the second cirrus. In the anterior ramus of the fourth pair, the
regular pairs of spines are rather crowded together in the upper part of
each segment, and the intermediate little spines and dorsal tufts are
rather long in comparison with those of the fifth and sixth pairs of
cirri: moreover, amongst the regular pairs, a few very minute and
thick spines, pointing upwards, could be perceived. So that we here
have the very unusual case of the fourth cirrus not exactly resembling
the fifth and sixth pairs; and we shall see, in the following species,
that this same anterior ramus of the fourth cirrus presents in addition
another very extraordinary character. In the sixth cirrus there are on
each segment four pairs of spines.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2">In general appearance and character this species comes very near to
<a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>. As in the latter, the parietes of the carino-lateral compartments
are narrow.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[104]</span></a> The orifice seems always to be smaller. Internally,
the parietes are generally much more strongly ribbed, and the edges of
the basal cup more plainly crenated. The sheath is generally coloured
of a brighter pink, sometimes tinged with orange. The average largest
specimens (from .3 to .5 of an inch in basal diameter) are a little larger
than the largest European specimens: I have seen one specimen from
Moreton Bay .4 in basal diameter, and from the basal cup being very
deep, actually .75 in height. The <i>scutum</i> has the articular ridge
not so prominent and not so abruptly cut off at the lower end, as in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A.
spongites</i></a>: on the other hand, the adductor ridge seems rather more
prominent; but these differences are trifling. In the <i>tergum</i> the
breadth of the spur (fig. <a href="#p09f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p09f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>) varies in specimens taken out of the

same valves in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, but generally the spur is broader and
squarer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_104_104" id="Footnote_104_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> In Mr. Cuming's collection there is a specimen,
from <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Sidney">Sydney</span>, which I fully
believe to be the present species, but cannot be positively sure, as the opercular
valves have been lost, which is very remarkable from the walls of the carino-lateral
compartments being reduced to the thickness of a mere thread, not
one twentieth of the width of the lateral compartments; we here see the
structure of <a href="#Acasta_sporillus"><i>Acasta sporillus</i></a> prefigured.</p></div>

<p>This species presents some remarkable varieties: in one specimen,
from Sydney, the parietes were externally ribbed longitudinally (fig. <a href="#p09f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>),
the ribs being roughened with minute points, giving to the shell an elegant
appearance; and this without doubt is the <i>A. sulcata</i> of Lamarck,
procured by Peron at Shark's Bay, lat. 25° S., on the opposite of the
Australian continent: some specimens from Port Lincoln, in South
Australia, were not ribbed, only smoothly striated in longitudinal
lines; although both sets of specimens had almost smooth scuta, and
were thus different from common specimens, yet there could be no
doubt, from their similarity in all other points, that they did not differ
specifically from them, though the latter had their scuta striated, but
not their parietes. Hence we see that there is no relation between the
striæ on the parietes and on the scuta. The Port Lincoln specimens, and
some others, were remarkable from the radii not extending down to the
basal cup, a minute cleft, covered only by membrane, being thus left
along the sutures, low down between the parietes (fig. <a href="#p09f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>); we shall
see this singular structure strongly developed in <i>A. perforata</i>. Owing
apparently to these clefts, the edge of the basal cup, exhibited traces
of six knob-like teeth, like those characteristic of <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The cirri resemble those of <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, with the exception
that the segments on the posterior pairs bear only three main pairs of
spines. With respect to the anterior ramus of the fourth pair of cirri,
the following very singular facts were observed:—in a specimen from
New South Wales (<i>var.</i> with the tergum having a narrow spur), on
two or three of the lower, but not on the lowest, segments, the
front margin was produced or developed into two or three minute,
thick teeth, slightly curved like hooks downwards: in other specimens
from New South Wales (<i>var.</i> with the tergum having a broad spur, and
inhabiting the same branch of sponge with the last-mentioned variety),
there was no trace of these teeth. But again, in two other specimens
with the tergum having a broad spur (collected by different persons,
near Sydney), and in another from South Australia, this structure was
carried to an extreme, for in these (as represented, Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f02">2</a>)
there were beautifully formed teeth on the fourteen lower segments
(the twelve upper being without them), and likewise on the upper segment
of the pedicel. These teeth are graduated in size on each segment;
they are admirably adapted for securing any prey; and, in fact,
they convert each segment into a mandible-like organ. On the segments,
on which these teeth are well developed, some of the regular
pairs of spines are aborted.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>—Finally, this species, if it be, as I believe, distinct, differs
from <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a> only in the internal surface of the parietes being
more strongly ribbed and brighter coloured,—in the edge of the basal
cup being more plainly crenated,—in the articular ridge of the scutum
being of a different shape,—in the spur of the tergum being often
broader,—in the segments of the posterior cirri having only three
pairs of main spines,—and, lastly, in the occasional presence of the
hook-like teeth on the anterior ramus of the fourth cirrus.</p>

<p class="p2">I feel more confidence in this case, than in that of <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A.
sulcata</i></a>, that we here have a distinct species, though at one
time I treated it only as a marked variety of <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>.
I rely chiefly on the great proportional width of the radii
of all the compartments, and on the width of the carino-lateral
compartments, compared with the lateral compartments,
and on the general shape of the shell, which differs
considerably from that of the two previous forms: in consequence
of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a> being attached to and imbedded in a
yielding substance, such as sponge, I believe external form
to be of more value as a specific character in this genus, than
in most sessile cirripedes. I have examined specimens taken
out of the yielding <i>Spongia officinalis</i> and out of an unusually
compact sponge, and they resembled each other in every
respect.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Colour pale pink, or that of flesh: basis remarkably
flat and rather small, with the walls above bulging out a little.
The radii are very wide, being wider than the parietes to which
they belong: the orifice is generally rather large. The parietes of the
carino-lateral compartments vary from one third to one fourth of the
width of the parietes of the lateral compartments. Basal diameter of
largest specimen .35 of an inch. Internally, the parietes are generally
more strongly ribbed than in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Opercular Valves</i> are large, owing to the form of the shell. The
<i>Scuta</i> present no particular character, and are not distinguishable from
those of <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a>; but the adductor ridge is perhaps rather more
developed. The <i>Terga</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f03c">3 <i>c</i></a>) are nearly as large as the scuta,
and this is an unusual circumstance; the spur is more than half as
wide as the valve; it is placed not quite close to the basi-scutal angle;
on the carinal side, the basal margin of the valve slopes a little towards
the spur. I may mention, that in several specimens from Madeira,

<p><i>Cirri</i>: these resemble, in every respect, those of <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, with
the remarkable exception that on the anterior ramus of the fourth
cirrus, several segments were furnished with the beautiful downward
curved, mandible-like teeth, as in <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a>; but differently from
in that species, there were none on the upper segment of the pedicel.
I should have thought this an excellent specific character, had not these
teeth been so extremely variable in <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a>.</p>

marked by longitudinal ridges, often in pairs, with the intermediate
furrows rather wide: spur of tergum nearly half as
wide as valve.</i></p>

<div class="habitat">

<p class="p2"><i>Fossil</i> in Coralline Crag (Sutton), Mus. S. Wood.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">I owe to Mr. Wood the inspection of a fine suite of
separate valves. Owing to the shell never having been
found entire, its general shape is not known, and, what is
of more consequence, the relative proportional width of the
parietes of the carino-lateral compartment is unknown. I
have (but with doubt) given it a distinct specific name,
owing to the peculiar character of the furrows on the scuta,
and to the large size of the whole shell. In its other
characters it comes nearest to <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, excepting in the
spur of the tergum, which resembles that of <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a>.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2">The compartments appear to have been rather smooth externally.
The radii are not wide, as in <a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>A. cyathus</i></a>; and the basis is cup-formed.
Internally, the parietes are feebly ribbed, as in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>.
Judging from the dimensions of the separated valves, this species must
have equalled and perhaps exceeded the size of the largest living
species, namely, <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>, from Australia. Hence we may infer, that
the basal diameter probably exceeded .55 of an inch: I may add, that
the largest European specimens of <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, from Naples and
Portugal, are only .3 of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—These seem to resemble the scuta of <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a> in all
respects, except in the longitudinal ridges standing much further apart,
and, consequently, in the furrows being much wider: each ridge is
generally double. Although there is a good deal of variability in the
character of these ridges in <a href="#Acasta_undulata"><i>A. undulata</i></a>, and likewise in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>,<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314" href="#Page_314"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span></a>
I have not seen any form intermediate between them. It must, however,
be confessed, that this is an extremely variable character in many
sessile cirripedes. In the <i>Terga</i>, the spur is about half the width of the
whole valve, and therefore rather wider than in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">This fine species seems to be extremely common, imbedded
in an open porose sponge on the eastern and
southern shores of Australia. It is very distinct from the
other species, with the exception of the following <a href="#Acasta_laevigata"><i>A. lævigata</i></a>,
which, with some hesitation, I have allowed to remain specifically
separated.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Excepting in its larger size, this species differs
in external appearance but little from <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>; its colour is pale
dirty reddish. The surface is generally studded with small calcareous
points. The parietes of the carino-lateral compartments are about
one fourth of the width of the parietes of the lateral compartments,
and therefore proportionally of the same width as in <a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>A. cyathus</i></a>.
The largest specimen which I have seen, was .55 of an inch in basal
diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—These are slightly narrower, thicker, and more convex than
in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>: they are strongly striated in longitudinal lines. The
articular ridge is very feebly developed. <i>Terga</i>: in full-grown specimens,
the spur is half the width of the whole valve, and is truncated;
its basal edge being parallel to the basal margin of the valve. The
articular ridge and crests for the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: depressores">depressor</span> muscles are very feebly
developed.</p>

<p><i>Internal structure of the parietes.</i>—The inner surface of the parietes
is quite smooth, without even a trace of ribs or teeth. But the most
important character is that the internal lateral margins on both sides of
each compartment, from the sheath to the basis, project inwards and
form a rim; so that when the shell is viewed from within (Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>,<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315" href="#Page_315"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span></a>
fig. <a href="#p09f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>, representing the lateral and carino-lateral compartments, and
part of the carina), the six sutures are seen to be strengthened by six
double columns.</p>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—This is moderately cup-formed. The edge, in order to meet
the basal points of the inwardly projecting lateral margins of the six
compartments, has six knob-like teeth. These are placed at unequal
distances, for two on each side stand near each other, owing to the
narrowness of the carino-lateral compartments. The degree of their
development varies extremely; when most developed, as in the specimen
figured (Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f05a">5 <i>a</i></a>), each tooth is bifid and a little hollowed
out, so as to receive the points of the two inwardly projecting margins
which form each suture. Ridges, more or less prominent, running from
each of the six marginal teeth, extend towards the centre of the cup. These
six teeth cannot be seen from the outside. The edge of the cup is rarely
crenated; but I have seen two instances in which this was the case.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—In the first pair, the rami are not quite so unequal as in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A.
spongites</i></a>; the longer ramus being about twice as long as the shorter.
In the third pair, there are some very minute, thick, upwardly-pointing
spines, which I did not notice in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>. In the fourth pair, the
spines are a little more crowded, with longer dorsal tufts, than in the
sixth pair; and they are mingled with some very minute, thick, upwardly
pointing spines. In young individuals, there are only three pairs
of main spines on the segments of the sixth pair, instead of four pairs.</p>

<p class="p2">This species, of which I have examined many specimens
from the above two and other unknown localities, agrees in
all essential points of structure with <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>, and consequently
I for some time classed them together; but the
characters, though usually of small value, by which this
form differs from <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a> being apparently constant, I<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316" href="#Page_316"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</span></a>
have with some doubt allowed it to remain specifically distinct.
These characters are, firstly, the much smaller size
of the whole shell in <a href="#Acasta_laevigata"><i>A. lævigata</i></a>; secondly, the edge of
its basal cup being always crenated, which seems to be a
rare accident in <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>; thirdly, though of secondary importance,
the scutum being here less plainly striated; and,
lastly, the spur of the tergum being of less breadth, and of a
more rounded outline; on the other hand, it must be confessed,
that when small specimens of <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a> are taken,
there is hardly any difference in the spurs of the terga.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—The surface of the
shell is often very smooth, but is sometimes studded with some small
sharp calcareous points. The colour is white, or pale reddish-brown;
but in the specimens from the Red Sea, the tint is more orange, with
the upper part of the shell white. The orifice of the shell is unusually
small. The largest specimen which I have seen was only .25 of an
inch in basal diameter, and therefore less than half the size of <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>.
The internal surfaces of the <i>parietes</i> are smooth, with the two lateral
margins inflected, as in <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>. The edge of the basal cup has six
knob-like teeth, like those in <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>, but smaller; and, in addition,
it is finely crenated.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: these differ only in being less plainly striated in longitudinal
lines; indeed, some specimens show hardly a trace of this structure.
<i>Terga</i>; these valves, in some varieties (Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f06b">6 <i>b</i></a>) can hardly be
distinguished from those of equal size from young individuals of <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A.
glans</i></a>; other varieties have the spur (Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f06a">6 <i>a</i></a>) not truncated, but
broadly pointed, and therefore of considerably different shape.</p>

<p>Neither in the mouth, nor cirri could I detect any difference with
<a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Hab.</i>—Philippine Archipelago, Mus. Cuming.</p>

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell rather elongated or tubular; with the
upper part reddish, and the surface roughened with very minute points.
The basal cup is generally as deep as the shell is high, ending down<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317" href="#Page_317"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</span></a>wards
in a blunt point, often curved to one side. The summits of the
radii, as usual, are oblique. The parietes of the carino-lateral compartments
are about half as wide as the parietes of the lateral compartments,
and are therefore of greater proportional width than in the foregoing
or any other species of the genus. The large membrane-covered
openings, or, as they may be called, windows, presently to be described,
between the lower halves of the compartments, is much the most
remarkable character of this species. The largest specimen which I
have seen was only .23 in diameter, and .6 of an inch in height, measured
from the basal point of the cup to the tips of the compartments.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—These barely exhibit a trace of longitudinal striæ. The
valve is rather thick and convex. The basi-tergal angle is much
rounded off. Internally, the articular ridge is thick and rather prominent.
<i>Terga</i>: the valve is furrowed in the line of the spur: the spur
is pointed and rather long; it is distinctly separated from the basi-scutal
angle of the valve, and the basal margin on the two sides of the
spur forms a straight line. The articular ridge is prominent, and short.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Parietes, Radii, and Basis.</i>—The parietes are internally
quite smooth down to its basis. The edges of the radii are also
smooth, as is the edge of the basal cup. The alæ project less than
usual. The radii are of moderate breadth, they extend downwards
only a little below the sheath, namely, about half way down the shell,
where they terminate, as usual, in a point. The increase in width,
during growth, of the radii, and their not extending down to the basis,
would necessarily cause a gap between the opposed edges of the walls,
in the portion beneath the radii; but besides this, the edges of the walls
themselves, beneath the radii, and on the opposed side beneath the alæ,
are hollowed out, but on the latter side or beneath the alæ sometimes in
a lesser degree. The result of this is, that the compartments, in their
lower halves, are separated from each other by membrane-covered
windows or apertures, arched at their upper ends, and of considerable
size, namely, about as wide as the parietes of the carino-lateral compartments.
I have only further to remark, that during the downward
growth of the parietes, the apertures increase in size, but at the same
time become closed up at their upper ends; and the arched layers of
shell added at these upper ends, assume a very different aspect from
the rest of the parietal surface,—appearing like two wedges, with their
points upwards, let in, on one side of the suture, between the ordinary
parietal surface and the radius, and, on the other side of the suture,
between the ordinary parietal surface and the recipient furrow of the
radius.</p>

<p>The <i>animal's body</i> was in a bad state of preservation; but, as far as
I could make out, the cirri resembled those of <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species differs from <a href="#Acasta_glans"><i>A. glans</i></a> in not having the
internal margins of the compartments projecting inwards. It differs
from all the ordinary varieties of <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>, in the smoothness of the
basal edges of the parietes and of the edge of the cup; in the greater
width of the carino-lateral compartment, though this is a variable point
in <a href="#Acasta_spongites"><i>A. spongites</i></a>; slightly in the shape of the scuta and terga; and, lastly,
in the large, membrane-covered openings between the compartments.</p>

in having membrane-covered apertures between the compartments,
and in some respects in its opercular valves: it is also
allied to <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a> and <a href="#Acasta_cyathus"><i>cyathus</i></a> in the parietes being often
internally ribbed, in the basal cup having a crenated edge,
and in the anterior ramus of the fourth cirrus being furnished
with the minute hook-like spines.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Sub-globular, slightly compressed, with a
rather small orifice; smooth, but sometimes furnished with sharp
shelly points; dull purple, more or less dark, with the upper parts of
the walls often white. The radii are rather narrow, and generally
white, with their summits only slightly oblique, but variable in this
latter respect. The parietes of the carino-lateral compartments are
narrow, being only one sixth of the width of the parietes of the
lateral compartments. In some specimens there are membrane-covered
apertures of considerable size, in others mere narrow clefts, between
the basal halves of the compartments. The basal cup is moderately
deep. The largest specimen was only .16 of an inch in basal
diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, rather broad, externally convex, not longitudinally striated:
articular ridge prominent, short, not extending down above one third
of the length of the valve. Depression for the adductor muscle deep.
On the internal surface, near to the rostral angle, a rather large purple
spot of corium adhered to the valve. <i>Terga</i>, broad, externally rather
convex: scutal margin protuberant: carinal margin slightly inflected,
or furnished internally with a rim: articular ridge prominent, very
short, not extending down above one fourth of the valve. Spur very
broad, rounded, confluent with the basi-scutal angle of the valve.</p>

<p><i>Internal Structure of the Parietes, Radii, and Basis.</i>—The parietes,
internally, are either quite smooth, or more commonly ribbed, with the<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319" href="#Page_319"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span></a>
basal edge in consequence crenated; the ribs are either placed at an
unusual distance from each other, and consequently are few in number,
or are pretty close together. The edge of the basal cup is either quite
smooth, or closely crenated, or distantly toothed, in conformity with
the state of the internal surface of the parietes. The radii have nearly
smooth edges, with their summits more or less oblique. They sometimes
extend down only three fourths, or only two thirds, of the length
of the shell, and the margins of the parietes under the radii being a
little hollowed out, the sutures are converted into clefts or apertures
(of course covered by membrane) like, but not so large as, those in
<a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>A. fenestrata</i></a>. The margins of the parietes are hollowed out only on
the side of the radius, and not on both sides of the sutures, as is most
usual in <a href="#Acasta_fenestrata"><i>A. fenestrata</i></a>. In some specimens the radii extended down
close to the basal cup, and only very minute clefts were left between
the opposed edges of the parietes.</p>

<p>In the <i>animal's body</i> the only noticeable character was, that on the
anterior ramus of the fourth pair of cirri, some of the segments were
furnished with very broad and thick, small, downwardly curved, teeth
or hooks, like those described in certain varieties of <a href="#Acasta_sulcata"><i>A. sulcata</i></a>; but
they are here stronger and thicker. The segments in the three posterior
pairs of cirri are not so much elongated, as in the other species.</p>

of the United States Antarctic Expedition, for two specimens
of this interesting species, which, in the singular reticulated
structure of the inner surface of the walls, and in
the almost rudimentary condition of the carino-lateral compartments,
not extending down to the basal cup, is very
distinct from the foregoing species. I have used Mr. Dana's
very appropriate MS. name of <i>sporillus</i>. The specimens
were dredged up, lying quite loose and unattached at the
bottom of the Sooloo sea; the one which I opened, must
have long lain dead; but Mr. Dana assures me that some
were living, and he has sent me drawings of parts of the
mouth and cirri: I am much surprised at this circumstance;<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320" href="#Page_320"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 320]</span></a>
for analogy would have made me believe that this species
must have been imbedded in some sponge-like body, such as
the bark of a zoophyte, and that it could not have lived
unattached. I may add that a small fragment of a brown
leathery substance adhered to the upper end of one of the
two specimens, and this seems to indicate attachment.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell shaped like a pointed acorn; slightly
flattened; orifice extremely small; surface very finely punctured,
covered by a purplish-brown epidermis, with transverse stripes of different
shades, and with the apex dark; according to Mr. Dana, when
fresh, the colour was purplish-carmine. Radii narrow, white. The
carino-lateral compartments are extremely narrow; the wall-portion
(fig. <a href="#p09f09b">9 <i>b</i></a>) forming a mere linear rib, terminating downwards in a sharp
point, which does not reach the basal cup: hence this compartment
evidently tends to become rudimentary. The basal cup is moderately
deep and pointed. Basal diameter .16; height, from the bottom of
the cup to the top of the shell, .24 of an inch.</p>

coloured by a pale purple, longitudinal band. Internally,
there is scarcely a trace of an articular ridge, which, in the other
species, is always more or less developed. <i>Terga</i> with the spur bluntly
pointed; nearly the whole basal margin, on the carinal side, slopes
towards the spur.</p>

<p><i>Internal Structure of the Parietes, Radii, and Basal Cup.</i>—The
parietes are strongly ribbed internally; and these ribs are connected by
very narrow, less prominent, transverse, slightly branched ridges, giving
a reticulated structure to the inner surface. Between several of the
main longitudinal ribs, in the lower part of the shell, new ribs may be
seen in process of formation, and these tend to convert the reticulated
structure into a double row of minute cells. I have not met with an
exactly similar structure in any other cirripede; but I have no doubt
that the little transverse ridges are homologous with the transverse calcareous
septa in the parietal pores of many Balani, in the same manner
as the internal longitudinal ribs, in this and other species of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>, are
homologous with the longitudinal septa forming the above pores. The
edge of the basal cup is pectinated with teeth, which lock into the
teeth formed by the ends of the internal parietal ribs. The radii are
narrow, and have smooth edges. The alæ project beyond the parietes
to a remarkably small extent. The sheath is free, or hollow beneath. I
have already described the almost rudimentary condition of the carino-lateral
compartments; this is best exhibited in an internal view of the
two compartments, as given in Pl. <a href="#Page_693">9</a>, fig. <a href="#p09f09b">9 <i>b</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Animal's body</i> unknown to me: from Mr. Dana's drawing the three
posterior pairs of cirri seem to have been much elongated: and the
rami of the first pair, as usual, unequal in length.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Compartments four, sometimes externally calcified together:
parietes permeated by pores, generally forming several rows.
Basis flat, irregular, calcareous, or membranous.</i></p>

<div class="habitat">

<p class="p2"><i>Hab.</i>—Throughout the tropical and warmer temperate seas.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shell is conical, more or
less depressed, and very rarely, even when growing in
crowded groups, becomes cylindrical or elongated. The
orifice is seldom large, generally diamond-shaped or oval.
The colour is either nearly white or purple, occasionally
even inky black, or very dark green, and sometimes of a
pale pink peach-blossom. The surface is sometimes smooth,
but more commonly longitudinally ribbed; the outer lamina
of shell is very often wholly corroded away, excepting close to
the basis, leaving the solidly upfilled parietal tubes exposed:
these give the shell a striated appearance, or they appear
like flattened tapering points adpressed to its surface (Pl. <a href="#Page_694">10</a>,<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322" href="#Page_322"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 322]</span></a>
fig. <a href="#p10f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>): Lamarck attempted to express this appearance, by
using the specific name of <i>stalactiferus</i>. The colour of the
shell depends, to a considerable extent, on the colour of the
shelly matter in these exposed parietal tubes. We shall
presently see that the corrosion and disintegration, to which
some of the species are so liable, plays an important part
during their growth. The radii are either well developed,
as in most of the species; or they are entirely absent, as in
the great majority of specimens of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a> and <a href="#Tetraclita_serrata"><i>serrata</i></a>. In
many individuals of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a> and <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>purpurascens</i></a> not only are
the radii absent, but the four compartments are calcified
together without any trace, on the external surface, of the
sutures. The largest specimen which I have seen of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T.
porosa</i></a>, which is the largest species, was two inches in basal
diameter, and nearly one inch and a half in height.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—These valves are sub-triangular, and either longitudinally
or transversely elongated. Externally, the
growth-ridges are moderately prominent, and in <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>T. costata</i></a>
and <a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>cœrulescens</i></a> they are crossed by longitudinal striæ.
Along the occludent margin, the inflected extremity of each
alternate growth-ridge is generally much thickened,—a set of
teeth being thus formed, by which the two valves are locked
together. In <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>, this character is variable, for sometimes
every alternate ridge, and sometimes only two or
three ridges, separated from each other by several growth-ridges,
are thus developed into teeth. The <i>articular</i> ridge
is either moderately prominent, or is extremely prominent,
as in <a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>T. cœrulescens</i></a>; but the lower edge in no case depends
as a free, hinge-like style, as sometimes in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The
<i>adductor</i> ridge is generally well developed and distinct
from the articular ridge: in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a> it is very blunt:
in <a href="#Tetraclita_serrata"><i>T. serrata</i></a> it is united to the articular ridge half way up
it, thus forming a deep tubular cavity running up to the
apex of the valve: in <a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>T. cœrulescens</i></a>, the adductor ridge is
very short, and is united to, or almost continuous with, the
lower end of the articular ridge, a small sub-cylindrical
tubular cavity being thus formed. Small crests exist for
the attachment of the rostral and lateral depressor muscles,
in most of the species, excepting <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a> and <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>costata</i></a>,
in which, however, more especially in the former, there are,<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323" href="#Page_323"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 323]</span></a>
instead of crests, minute pits for the attachment. These
crests vary much in prominence in the same species.</p>

<p><i>Terga.</i>—These valves present no essential differences
from those of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>; they are sometimes beaked, and the
beak is hollow and occupied by a thread of corium, as in that
genus. The external surface of the valve is often depressed
in the line of the spur, but there is never a longitudinal
furrow with the edges folded in, as in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The spur is
very short in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>. In <a href="#Tetraclita_radiata"><i>T. radiata</i></a>, the articular
ridge is remarkably prominent. The crests for the depressor
muscles are well developed in all the species. The shape of
the terga is variable in nearly all the species, and greatly so
in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Compartments.</i>—Owing to there being only four compartments,
the lateral pair are large; the size of the carina relatively
to the rostrum varies, according as its alæ have been
added to during diametric growth. The walls are very thick,
and are composed of numerous tubes, in some species as
many as fourteen or fifteen rows being exposed on the basal
margin (Pl. <a href="#Page_694">10</a>, fig. <a href="#p10f01g">1 <i>g</i></a>). The tubes are generally angular,
and slightly elongated in the ray of the circular shell;
sometimes they are nearly circular and small. New tubes
are formed only at the basal edge of the outer lamina, by the
bifurcation of the septa which form the tubes. In very young
specimens there is only a single row of tubes; and in <a href="#Tetraclita_rosea"><i>T. rosea</i></a>
this holds good throughout life: in this species (fig. <a href="#p10f03d">3 <i>d</i></a>) the
tubes, in the single row, are large and quadrangular, and the
outer lamina of shell is strengthened by numerous, small, internal,
longitudinal plates. I believe the branching septa,
which separate and form the parietal tubes, correspond with
the longitudinal septa in the more simple walls of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>.
The tubes become solidly filled up, in their upper parts,
with hard, and generally coloured shelly matter. The degree
to which they are filled up differs in the different species;
the external side of each tube is always first thus coated.
The thin outer lamina of shell, in several of the species,
commonly disintegrates and disappears; the upfilled parietal
tubes being thus exposed. The inner lamina of the walls is
generally smooth, but in <a href="#Tetraclita_radiata"><i>T. radiata</i></a> it is longitudinally ribbed,
as in most species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The sheath is generally dark-<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324" href="#Page_324"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 324]</span></a>coloured;
its lower edge does not project or overhang the
inner lamina, as is usual in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, excepting in <a href="#Tetraclita_serrata"><i>T. serrata</i></a>,
and in some few varieties of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Radii</i>, when developed, are either narrow or
broad, with their summits either oblique or extending in
a straight line from the top of one compartment to that
of another. In <a href="#Tetraclita_serrata"><i>T. serrata</i></a>, I have not seen a single specimen
with the radii developed; in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>, they are very
seldom developed, and then, apparently, only in quite young
specimens, in which they are narrow; in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>,
they seem to be about as often developed as not, and when
present they are broad; in <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>T. costata</i></a>, <a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>cœrulescens</i></a>, and
<a href="#Tetraclita_radiata"><i>radiata</i></a>, they are always largely developed. In some specimens
of the species, in which the radii are not developed,
even the sutures do not reach the external surface; the outer
lamina of the parietes being continuous all round, so that
the shell seems formed of a single piece. Even in such
specimens, the four compartments, viewed from within, can
be seen to be distinct; and the sutures can generally be
traced across the whole thickness of the parietal tubes; in
this latter case, when the sutures are broken open, the radii
are seen to be represented (Pl. <a href="#Page_694">10</a>, <a href="#p10f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>) by a few small
sinuous ridges. Owing to the disintegration of the upper
and outer part of the shell, and the consequent exposure of
parts of the sheath and alæ, the radii sometimes appear as if
developed, when such is not the case. With respect to the
internal structure of the radii, they are formed, in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>
and <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>costata</i></a>, of tubes, like those of the parietes, and
therefore according to the normal plan; whilst in the other
species they are formed by longitudinal sinuous ridges,
sending out on each side irregular denticuli; and the interspaces
between the ridges are filled up solidly during the
growth of the radii, in all the species, except in <a href="#Tetraclita_radiata"><i>T. radiata</i></a>, in
which they are left to a considerable extent open. These sinuous
ridges, with their denticuli, homologically represent the
branching septa which form the parietal tubes. The edges of
the alæ are crenated in all the species, except in <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>T. costata</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Diametric growth.</i>—When first examining groups of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T.
porosa</i></a>, in none of which the radii had been developed, and
in which, consequently, the shell could not have grown in<a name="Page_325" id="Page_325" href="#Page_325"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 325]</span></a>
diameter, but only at its basal margin, I was at first unable to
comprehend, how the upper part of the shell and the orifice
could have acquired their proper proportional width. The
young shell, at its first formation, starts with an orifice so small
that a pin could hardly be inserted in it; and this in many
individuals is never increased in diameter by the diametric
growth of the shell; but in place of this, as the conical shell
is added to at its base, the whole upper part disintegrates
and wears away, the orifice becoming thus enlarged. We
thus see that the corrosion and wearing away of the upper
part of the shell is a necessary element in its growth. The
development of the radii, which in some of the species, as in
<a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>, at first seems to be quite capricious, really
depends upon the fact, whether the specimens have been
exposed to disintegration; for I have almost always found
that when the outer lamina of shell has been well preserved,
the radii have been developed, and the orifice has been enlarged
by their growth, instead of by the wearing down of
the upper part of the conical shell.</p>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—This consists of a very thin, flat, though irregular,
translucent, calcareous plate, which towards the edges is
sometimes membranous. In <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>, the basis is
entirely membranous. When a portion of the calcareous
base is dissolved in acid, a tissue is left, composed of several
laminæ, to which numerous bifurcating cement-ducts are
attached: even before dissolution, these delicate bifurcating
ducts can just be perceived by the aid of a simple lens.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The several organs present no particular characters.
There are generally three teeth on each side of the
notch in the labrum. The palpi usually have parallel sides,
but are club-shaped in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a> and <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>costata</i></a>. The
mandibles have generally four teeth, but there are five in
<a href="#Tetraclita_vitiata"><i>T. vitiata</i></a>, and only three in <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>T. costata</i></a>. The maxillæ are
notched. The outer maxillæ are bilobed in front.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The segments of the three posterior pairs usually
support only three pairs of main spines, but there are four
pairs in <a href="#Tetraclita_vitiata"><i>T. vitiata</i></a> and <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>costata</i></a>: between each pair, there is
either a tuft of fine spines, or a single fine spine. The rami
of the first cirrus are unequal in length. In the third cirrus,
the posterior ramus is sometimes much elongated, but some<a name="Page_326" id="Page_326" href="#Page_326"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 326]</span></a>times
both rami are short and blunt. Some of the segments
in the third cirrus often support very coarsely and doubly
pectinated spines. Under the head of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>, it will be
seen to what a remarkable degree the relative numbers of
the segments in the several cirri vary, even in specimens
taken out of the same cluster.</p>

<p>The <i>Branchiæ</i> are well developed (at least in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>
and <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>costata</i></a>), as a large, plicated, tapering fold, with a small
second fold on the inner side at the base. In <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a> the
<i>stomach</i> is destitute of cæca. The <i>vesiculæ seminales</i> in
this same species are large, with their broad, blunt ends
reflexed. The <i>ovarian</i> tubes surround the sack, and cover
the basal plate.</p>

<p><i>Distribution and Habitats.</i>—This genus is confined to
the tropics, and to the warmer parts of the temperate seas:
in the southern hemisphere, it ranges south, to the Cape of
Good Hope and to Van Diemen's Land: in the northern
hemisphere it does not appear to range so far; I do not
know of any authentic case of a species having been found
in the Mediterranean, or on the shores of the United States,
north of the West Indies. <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a> is found round
the whole world; <a href="#Tetraclita_radiata"><i>T. radiata</i></a>, also, has a very wide range,
inhabiting the West Indies, the East Indian Archipelago,
and New South Wales. This latter species, as well as
<a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>T. cœrulescens</i></a>, is often attached to the bottoms of ships,
adhering to <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>. The several species
live attached to tidal rocks, to littoral shells, or to massive
corals. I have met with two instances, in the West Indies
and the Philippine Archipelago, of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a> adhering to
wood. <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a> seems to feed chiefly on crustaceans:
the number and the size of the amphipods, isopods, and
entomostracans, together with an annelid, in the stomachs of
some specimens from South America, was quite surprising.
As many as five species occur in the same region, in the
eastern half of the world; thus on the shores of New South
Wales, we have <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>, <a href="#Tetraclita_vitiata"><i>vitiata</i></a>, <a href="#Tetraclita_radiata"><i>radiata</i></a>, <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>purpurascens</i></a>,
and <a href="#Tetraclita_rosea"><i>rosea</i></a>; in the Philippine Archipelago, we have <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>,
<a href="#Tetraclita_vitiata"><i>vitiata</i></a>, <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>costata</i></a>, and <a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>cœrulescens</i></a>.</p>

<p>I have not seen any species of this genus fossil.</p>


<p><i>Variation.</i>—The species vary in shape nearly, but not<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327" href="#Page_327"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 327]</span></a>
quite as much as in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, for we very rarely here see
cylindrical varieties; but in the same species, we have
extremely depressed, steeply conical, and convex forms;
the orifice varies in relative size; the state of the surface,
whether ribbed or smooth, whether well preserved or corroded,
the upfilled parietal tubes being thus exposed, varies
more than in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The colour also varies; specimens of
<a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_694">10</a>, fig. <a href="#p10f01a">1 <i>a</i></a> to <a href="#p10f01f">1 <i>f</i></a>) being dark purple, or even
inky black, white, pale pinkish-purple, and green: as far as
I have seen, the pinkish varieties of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a> are confined to
the eastern half of the world. Even the ridges and crests on
the under side of the scutum vary in some degree; and the
tergum in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a> varies considerably, and in some of the
other species, slightly, in general shape: I believe that the
tergum becomes narrow and elongated, when the shell is
steeply conical, with the orifice of small diameter. After
having spent several days in disarticulating and closely examining
the many specimens of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a> in my possession,
I concluded that its varieties formed at least four species,
these being in external appearance extremely distinct; but
ultimately the many intermediate forms compelled me to
unite all into a single species. Again, I may instance the
conical, ribbed variety of <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_695">11</a>, fig. <a href="#p11f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>),
with the outer lamina of the shell preserved and with the
radii widely developed, as having not the smallest resemblance
to the other common depressed variety (fig. <a href="#p11f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>),
having a granulated surface, produced by the exposed tips of
the upfilled parietal tubes, and without a trace of the radii
or even of the sutures; I may add that, according to the
characters used by some authors, these two varieties would
be classed in two separate genera.</p>

<p>To distinguish the species of this genus, the chief reliance
must be placed (as in the case of most other sessile cirripedes)
on the general outline of the opercular valves, and
on the ridges and crests on their under sides: the internal
structure, however, of the radii, and in a lesser degree of
the parietes, must not be overlooked. I have not found the
parts of the mouth, or the differences in the cirri, of much
service; and it will be shown under <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>, that the<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328" href="#Page_328"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 328]</span></a>
relative numbers of the segments in the several cirri, and
even their shape, is extraordinarily variable.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—All the species are pretty closely allied, and
there is no ground for making any sectional division of the
eight species, more especially not on the ground whether or
no the radii are developed. <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>Tetraclita purpurascens</i></a>, taking
into account all the characters, including the animal's
body, is perhaps the most distinct species in the genus, but
it is closely allied to <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>T. costata</i></a>. In the well-marked
character of the parietes being formed of a single row of
large tubes, <a href="#Tetraclita_rosea"><i>T. rosea</i></a> differs from all the other species. The
genus is closely allied to <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>; I can point out no
difference in the animal's body, nor any constant difference
in the opercular valves. The ridges and crests on the under
sides of the scuta are more prominent in <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>; and
all the species, excepting two, have crests (though sometimes
very slight) for the attachment of the rostral depressor
muscle, and these occur only in two species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>:
crests, also, for the attachment of the lateral depressor
muscle are common in <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, but rare in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The
main character, however, of the genus, as compared with
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, is derived from the existence of only four compartments,
and in a lesser degree from the several rows of
parietal pores; but, as just stated, <a href="#Tetraclita_rosea"><i>T. rosea</i></a> has only a single
row, and, on the other hand, in <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>Balanus crenatus</i></a>, there is
a slight tendency exhibited, in the dividing of the longitudinal
septa near the outer lamina, to form a second row of
parietal pores; and in <a href="#Balanus_cariosus"><i>B. cariosus</i></a>, moreover, we actually
have two or three rows of irregular and very short pores.
The thin, yet solid calcareous basis which occurs in all the
species of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, excepting <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>, resembles
the basis in <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>Balanus flosculus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>imperator</i></a>, but I suspect
that the structure of the cement-ducts is different in the
two genera.</p>

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—This, the widest-distributed and much the
commonest species of the genus, varies greatly in external appearance.
The usual shape is steeply conical, but some individuals are much
depressed. In the common varieties the outer lamina of shell has
been removed even close to the basal edge; the upfilled parietal tubes
being thus exposed (fig. <a href="#p10f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), as flattened adpressed points. These
points are largest in large specimens, but they vary somewhat in size
in specimens of equal growth. When the outer surface is preserved,
it is generally ribbed longitudinally, but is sometimes quite smooth.
The most general colour is dirty gray or dark purple; but many specimens
are pale pinkish-purple, owing to the exposure of the parietal
tubes upfilled with shelly matter of this tint: there are also, as given
under the characters of the <i>vars.</i>, black, white and green varieties. The
sheath is always tinted by the prevailing colour. The radii are rarely
developed, but generally the four sutures are distinct; sometimes these
are externally quite obliterated, the shell, as seen from the outside,
consisting of a single piece like a patella or fissurella. When the radii
are developed they are very narrow, with their upper edges oblique:
their development seems always coincident with the more or less
perfect preservation of the shell, and their function is to enlarge the
orifice; the enlargement being usually effected by the disintegration and
removal of the whole upper part of the conical shell. The size of the
orifice varies considerably; in the seventh variety it was extraordinarily
small: in outline it varies from oval to rounded trigonal or rhomboidal;
in some specimens, with the radii well developed, it was rounded pentagonal.</p>

<p><i>Size.</i>—<a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a> is the largest species of the genus; I have
seen specimens attached to a large pebble of granite in the British
Museum, which measured two inches in basal diameter, and nearly one
inch and a half in height.</p>

<p><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331" href="#Page_331"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 331]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: these are sub-triangular and generally a little elongated, but
they vary slightly in relative breadth (fig. <a href="#p10f01i">1 <i>i</i></a>, <a href="#p10f01l">1 <i>l</i></a>), and likewise in the
degree to which the basi-tergal angle is rounded off. The under surface
is clouded with dull or pinkish-purple, or with green, or is nearly white.
The articular ridge is not prominent, and the articular furrow is narrow.
The adductor ridge is prominent, and runs upwards for some distance
close and parallel to the articular ridge; and sometimes it extends
nearly or quite up to the apex of the valve; in one single specimen
the adductor ridge had an abraded appearance, and was very little
developed. The crests for the rostral and lateral depressores are sharp
and distinct. Along the occludent margin, the ends generally of the
alternate lines of growth are enlarged into knobs, serving to lock the
two valves together; but in many specimens only two or three knobs,
at intervals of several lines of growth (fig. <a href="#p10f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), are developed.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>: when the upper end of the valve is not corroded, there is a
distinct beak, hollow within for a thread of corium. The scutal
margin is not much inflected, and the articular ridge not very prominent.
The spur is placed quite close to the basi-scutal angle of the
valve, so that there is no basal margin on that side of the valve. <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Te">The</span>
width of the valve and of the spur, and the acumination of the extremity
of the latter, varies in a remarkable manner. In the broad
and commonest variety (fig. <a href="#p10f01k">1 <i>k</i></a>), the basal margin of the valve form
an angle of about 130° with the carinal side of the spur, and the basal
end of the spur is broad and truncated. In the less common and
narrow variety (<a href="#p10f01m">1 <i>m</i></a>), the basal margin in some extreme cases forms
very nearly a straight line with the carinal side of the spur; and the
spur itself is bluntly pointed: in <i>var.</i> 7 it is sharply pointed.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the parietes and radii.</i>—In all cases the four sutures
are quite distinct, from top to bottom, on the internal lamina of the
shell, and generally they run through the whole thickness of the walls,
and are visible externally. Often they do not quite reach the outer
lamina, and then the shell externally consists of a single piece, like a
patella. Sometimes the sutures can be traced running through the
parietal tubes only for a short distance from the internal surface; where
they cease, the two walls of the suture become fused together. When
a perfect suture is split open, the radius is represented (fig. <a href="#p10f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>) by a
few narrow, sinuous ridges, sending out on each side little branches or
denticuli; these are received into corresponding furrows in the opposed
compartment. These ridges run nearly parallel to each other, and somewhat
obliquely, from the outer lamina of the shell to the basis. When
the radii are developed, their edges are similarly formed, by sinuous
denticulated ridges, with the interspaces between them filled up solidly.
The alæ are but little prominent.</p>

<p>The <i>mouth</i> does not deviate from the generic type. The <i>cirri</i> are
remarkable from the variability in the several pairs of the relative numbers
of their segments, as shown in the following table. The segments
do not correspond even on opposite sides of the same individual, as may
be seen in the two lower lines of the table. I believe that variability
to this degree is very uncommon in other cirripedes, though, as stated
in the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>, the number of the segments always increases with<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332" href="#Page_332"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 332]</span></a>
the growth of the individual. The terminal segments in the longer
rami of both the first and third cirrus are antenniformed,—being
elongated, and of a different shape, with fewer bristles, compared with
the basal segments of the same cirri. It is apparently these terminal
segments which are particularly liable to vary in number. In both rami
of the third cirrus, some of the segments, from the sixth to the eleventh
inclusive, (counting from the bottom), more especially the eighth, ninth,
and tenth, carry a few spines coarsely and doubly pectinated; but as
some of the adjoining segments carry spines which may be called
doubly serrated, it is not easy to draw an exact line of demarcation.
Sometimes, though rarely, a few of the nearly terminal segments in the
second cirrus are furnished with similar, doubly pectinated spines.</p>

<p><i>Varieties.</i>—Under the generic description, I have stated that after
having spent some time in examining a very large suite of specimens of
<a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>, I concluded that at least four of the varieties were true species.
It so happened that all the specimens which I first examined of the <i>var.</i>
(4) <i>rubescens</i>, had the narrow sloping terga, and scuta with only two
or three great teeth on their occludent margins; but ultimately, in a
group thus characterised, I found one or two individuals with terga
precisely of the shape of those in <i>var.</i> (1) <i>communis</i>. Again, in a group
of dull purple specimens of <i>var. communis</i>, a few had the narrow
sloping terga, and scuta with teeth on their occludent margins, intermediate
in size and number between the varieties with only one or two<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333" href="#Page_333"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 333]</span></a>
great teeth, and those with every alternate growth-ridge enlarged into
a tooth. Hence <i>var. rubescens</i> completely broke down as a species.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>var.</i> (5) <i>elegans</i> (a M.S. specific name of Leach) I
inferred at first, from external appearance alone, that it was distinct;
the outer lamina of the shell and even the epidermis is preserved; the
surface is strongly ribbed, and the whole shell, excepting the sheath,
is nearly white; the terga are narrow, with a sloping basal margin as
in <i>var.</i> (4) <i>rubescens</i>. Whole groups of specimens are thus characterised.
But as <i>var. communis</i> is often white, and as the surface, when
the outer lamina is preserved, is generally, as we shall presently see,
ribbed longitudinally, the differences in <i>var. elegans</i> are quite unimportant.</p>

<p>The (6th) <i>var.</i> differs from <i>var. communis</i> only in the narrow radii
having been developed, and consequently in the orifice being pentagonal,
and in the outer, longitudinally ribbed lamina of the shell having
been preserved. In the same group of specimens, I have seen every
intermediate stage between this and the common form. It must not,
however, be supposed that the young of <i>var. communis</i> always pass
through these stages, for such is not the case. In the genus <i><a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a></i>
it has been seen, how capricious in some species is the development of
the radii.</p>

<p>Of the other varieties, enumerated at the beginning, no further mention
is required, excepting with respect to <i>var.</i> (7), the most singular
of all. I have seen only three specimens, sent to me by Dr. Aug.
Gould, of Boston, United States, and these from the appearance of
their bases I have no doubt had been attached to a ship,—the only instance
which I have met with, in the present species. The shell is
steeply conical, with the orifice so small as to be reduced to a mere
pore; the radii are extremely narrow and white; the shell is thin,
with the surface smooth, but ribbed longitudinally and regularly; the
outer lamina of the shell and the epidermis are perfectly preserved; the
upper part of the shell is reddish purple, which dies away towards the
base: careful examination of the apex shows that at the first growth
the young shell was blueish-green. The terga are narrow, with a
sloping basal margin, as in <i>var. rubescens</i>, but with the point of the
spur sharper. I have formerly remarked that the shape of the terga
seems influenced by the size of the orifice. The lower edge of the sheath
depends freely: I have seen no other instance of this latter structure,
so common, but so variable, in <i><a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a></i>, in the present species, except
to a partial extent in one distorted specimen, in Mr. Stutchbury's collection,
adhering to <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>, and probably taken from
a ship's bottom. I may add that this distorted specimen was remarkable
from its radii being wider than in any other instance,—from its
smooth uncoloured surface without longitudinal ribs,—and from the
perfect preservation of the epidermis over its entire surface. Although
Dr. Gould's specimens, in external aspect, are absolutely and entirely
different from the common varieties of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>, there are so many
intermediate forms, and the differences are so little important that I
feel no hesitation in attributing them to variation, consequent on the
individuals having been exposed to unusual conditions, attached to the
bottom of a ship.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_108_108" id="Footnote_108_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108_108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> I have seen three separate lots of this species all from the Cape of Good
Hope; one lot was collected by Dr. Krauss, at Algoa Bay, and I strongly
suspect is the species described by him in his 'Südafrikanischen Mollusken' as
<i>Conia porosa</i>. If the species, figured by Chemnitz, and mentioned in a note
(p. <a href="#Page_329">329</a>), under <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>, be the present species, the specimens probably did not
come from Tranquebar, on which point Chemnitz speaks only from memory. I
have seen one specimen ticketed New South Wales, it is possible, considering
the case of <a href="#Tetraclita_rosea"><i>T. rosea</i></a>, that this may be correct, but I should like to have further
confirmation before giving it as a habitat.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Colour dark greenish gray; form steeply
conical; surface covered, especially in the lower half of the shell, by
numerous, narrow, sharp, longitudinal ridges, but slightly prominent,
and serrated or transversely divided into small teeth: when the shell
has been much disintegrated, the upper part of the surface consists of
the exposed, smooth, rather large, upfilled parietal tubes. I have seen
no instance of the development of the radii; sometimes even the
sutures are with great difficulty distinguishable, though I believe they
always reach the outer surface; sometimes the sutures are wide from
the disintegration of the edges of the compartments. Orifice rounded
or oval.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—The scuta and carinal half of the terga are blueish-green.
In the scuta neither the articular ridge or furrow are much developed:
the adductor ridge is prominent, and is united to the articular ridge,
about half way up the latter, thus forming a rather large, triangular
cavity, which runs up to the apex of the valve.</p>

<p>The <i>Terga</i> are beaked. The spur, measured across the upper part,
is half as wide as the valve; it is bluntly pointed; it is placed quite
close to the basi-scutal angle of the valve, so that there is no basal
margin on that side; it curves towards the scutum, its extremity extending
beyond the basi-scutal angle.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Shell and Radii.</i>—The parietal tubes are rather large,
especially those adjoining the inner lamina of the walls. The shell
is of singularly little specific gravity, which is due to the parietal tubes
not being filled up with shelly matter nearly to so great an extent as in
the other species; even in the uppermost part the tubes are not solidly
filled up, only their external sides are thickly coated with greenish-black
shell, which by corrosion becomes grayish. The radii, as
stated, are not developed: the shell breaks with singular facility along
the sutures, and the radii are then seen to be most feebly represented<a name="Page_335" id="Page_335" href="#Page_335"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 335]</span></a>
by a few very small branching ridges. The alæ have their edges
plainly crenated. The sheath is dark green, with the lower edge free.</p>

<p>The <i>Mouth</i> presents no particular characters. With regard to the
<i>Cirri</i>, I am doubtful whether any confidence can be placed in the
numbers of the segments being constant; but I may state that the second
cirrus contained thirteen and sixteen segments in its two rami; the
third cirrus only fourteen in both rami; and the sixth cirrus twenty-six
segments in both rami. Whereas in every specimen of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>,
the longer ramus of the third cirrus contained more segments than
either ramus of the second. About half the segments, namely, those
in the middle of both rami of the third cirrus, are furnished with
coarsely and doubly pectinated spines, like those in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—Upon the whole, this species is more nearly allied to <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T.
porosa</i></a> than to any other. In the cavity formed by the union of the adductor
and articular ridges, it is allied to <a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>T. cœrulescens</i></a>. This species
differs from all, in its little specific gravity, consequent on the parietal
tubes being only slightly filled up, and in the peculiarly serrated,
narrow, approximate ridges on the external surface of the walls. The
character derived from the adductor ridge, just alluded to, is remarkable.
In the shape of the terga, in the absence of radii, and in the
structure of the body, this species approaches closely to <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>.</p>

Twofold Bay; South Africa, Algoa Bay. Attached, in Australia, to littoral
rocks and shells; often associated with <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>, <a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>Chthamalus antennatus</i></a>,

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell steeply conical, often rather convex;
dirty or brownish white, feebly tinted with pink; external surface
generally much disintegrated, and having in the upper part a pillared
appearance, owing to the exposure of the upfilled, large, square, parietal<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336" href="#Page_336"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 336]</span></a>
tubes, and, in the lower part, a striated (and sometimes serrated) appearance,
from the exposure of the parallel, approximate plates, with
which the outer lamina of the shell is internally strengthened. In
only a few young specimens, the whole outer lamina of the shell was
well preserved; and in these the surface was very smooth, and even
glossy, giving to the specimens a quite different aspect; even in partially
corroded specimens, the lower part of the shell sometimes is quite
smooth. Generally, the radii are developed; in most specimens they
are narrow, but sometimes of moderate width; their summits are
oblique, and their edges often notched or toothed. The recipient
furrow, in each opposed compartment, is often almost as wide as the
radius itself, and is equally notched. In some much corroded specimens
there were no radii. Basal diameter of largest specimen, 1.1 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, generally thick, sometimes very thick, with the external surface
usually much corroded: articular furrow rather wide; articular
ridge not very prominent; adductor ridge prominent. The rostral
depressor muscle is attached in a small oblong pit, sometimes including
little crests; and the lateral depressor muscle is attached to what may
be described either as three or four parallel furrows or crests.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>, with the spur placed close to the basi-scutal angle, so that
there is no basal margin on that side; spur short, with its lower end
truncated and rounded; broad, even exceeding, when measured across
the upper part, half the width of the valve. Articular furrow wide.
Apex not beaked.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Walls and Radii.</i>—This species differs from all the others
of the genus in having only a single row (fig. <a href="#p10f03d">3 <i>d</i></a>) of parietal tubes; these
are large, quadrangular, but elongated in the ray of the circle. They are
not filled up, even at the very top of the shell, but they become thickly
lined all round with compact shelly matter. When the surface of the
shell is disintegrated, these upfilled tubes greatly affect, as already
stated, the external appearance. The outer lamina near the basis is
internally strengthened by longitudinal, sharp, approximate ridges or
plates, which, also, often affect, after corrosion, the external appearance.
The <i>radii</i> have their sutural edges formed by a set of narrow, branching
ridges or septa; the ends of which, seen externally, often give a
notched outline to this edge; the recipient furrows in the opposed
compartments are deep, and their edges likewise are often notched:
the interspaces between the branching ridges are filled up solidly. The
<i>alæ</i> have their edges coarsely crenated. The lower edge of the sheath
is not free.</p>

<p>The <i>mouth</i> and <i>cirri</i> present no particular characters: the third
cirrus has both its rami elongated, with the terminal segment tapering.
In the three posterior pairs of cirri, the tufts of little spines between
the main pairs are rather large.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species has no particular affinity with any other.
The circumstance of there being only a single row of parietal tubes is
not so important a difference as might at first be thought, inasmuch as
in the other species, during their quite early youth, the walls are
formed of only a single row of tubes or pores.</p>

Generally attached to tidal rocks, sometimes to shells. Very
common.</p>

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell generally much depressed, in a few
cases rather steeply conical, in one single instance cylindrical, but not
much elongated. Colour, when alive, pale, but fine purple; I presume,
judging from some <span class="correction" title="In the original book: dryed">dried</span> specimens, sometimes dirty white. The state of
the surface varies remarkably: about half the specimens (fig. <a href="#p11f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>) which I
have seen, had the outer lamina of shell quite removed, and the surface
granulated, owing to the projecting and exposed tips of the upfilled parietal
tubes; the radii are not developed, and often even there is no trace of the
four sutures; the rather large orifice is somewhat rounded, and the two
scuta, with their surfaces disintegrated, have their middle parts deeply
indenting the terga. The shell, in the other and perhaps more common
condition (fig. <a href="#p11f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), has the outer lamina preserved, and is longitudinally
ribbed with generally at least five or six ribs on each compartment:
the radii are here very wide, and extend from tip to tip of the compartments,
so that their summits are parallel to the basis; they are gene<a name="Page_338" id="Page_338" href="#Page_338"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 338]</span></a>rally
covered by a brownish epidermis, thickly clothed with little
spines; the orifice is neatly diamond-shaped; the apices of the opercular
valves meet at a common point: these specimens are almost
always smaller and younger than the granulated specimens. Altogether
the specimens in the two opposite states have, in their external
appearance, nothing in common, and no one, without careful examination,
would ever suspect that they were specifically identical; this,
however, was proved by the intermediate forms, and, in one instance,
three of the compartments had their surfaces granulated, and were entirely
destitute of the radii, whilst the fourth by some chance had been
preserved from corrosion, was longitudinally ribbed, and had its epidermis-covered
radius fully developed. The difference in the appearance
of the opercular valves, in the two states, is simply owing to the
degradation of their upper parts in the granulated specimens.</p>

<p>The basal diameter of the largest specimen was one inch, but the
height only .35 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, transversely elongated, so that the basal margin is nearly
twice as long as the tergal margin: articular ridge very little prominent;
articular furrow wide but shallow; adductor ridge very blunt, slightly
prominent, sometimes almost absent, almost parallel to the basal margin:
there are no distinct crests for the rostral or lateral <span class="correction" title="In the original book: depressores">depressor</span>
muscles, but some small irregular pits for the latter. In one young
specimen, the lines of growth were crenated, showing a tendency in
the valve to become longitudinally striated, as in the allied <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>T. costata</i></a>.
In some young and immature specimens, the basal margin was deeply
sinuous.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>, small in area, not above half that of the scuta: spur extremely
short, broad, placed close to the basi-scutal angle of the valve, so that
there is no basal margin on that side of the spur. The lower end and
sides of the spur form one uniform curve. Articular ridge barely developed.
Crests for the tergal depressores sharp and prominent.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Shell and Radii.</i>—The walls are very thick, and the
parietal tubes small and numerous; there are sometimes from twelve to
fifteen rows of tubes in the thickness of the wall. The tubes in their
whole upper part are filled up solidly; and, as we have seen, are often
exposed by disintegration. In very young specimens, of that size in
which in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a> there would be only a single row of parietal tubes,
there were here two or three rows. The development of the radii, as
we have seen, is very capricious; the sutures even sometimes being
lost. The radii, when developed, are broad, square on the summit,
and covered by brownish hirsute epidermis: internally they are formed
of tubes like those forming the parietes; in this respect differing from
all the species except the following, <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>T. costata</i></a>. The tubes in the
radii run obliquely down towards the basis; instead of in a transverse
line, directly towards the opposite compartment, as might have been expected
from the structure of the radii in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The alæ have their
edges finely crenated. The sheath in all the specimens which I have
observed is colourless; its lower edge is not free. The corium entering
the parietal tubes, and lining the opercular valves, the mouth, and the
anterior cirri, is generally of an extremely dark purple colour.</p>

<p><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339" href="#Page_339"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 339]</span></a></p>

<p>The <i>Basis</i> is entirely membranous, in which respect this species
differs from all the others in the genus.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: all the trophi are unusually hairy or spinose. The labrum is
deeply notched and apparently destitute of teeth on the crest. The
palpi are club-shaped or enlarged at their extremities. The mandibles
have the fourth tooth rudimentary.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cirri</i>, the second and third pairs are remarkably short and
blunt. In one specimen the two rami of the first cirrus had respectively
six and sixteen segments; those of the second, six and seven;
those of the third, seven and seven; and those of the sixth cirrus
twenty rather elongated segments, with a small tuft of spines between
each main pair of spines.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species differs from all, in its membranous basis,
and in its transversely elongated scuta. It resembles <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>T. costata</i></a>, and
differs from all the other species, in its radii (when developed) being
square on the summit, and in being formed of tubes,—in the smallness
and number of the parietal tubes,—in the absence of crests
on the under side of the scuta for the rostral and lateral depressor
muscles,—in the shortness and rounded form of the spur to the terga,—and,
lastly, in the club-shaped palpi and small size or absence of the
fourth tooth in the mandibles. <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a> differs from <a href="#Tetraclita_costata"><i>T. costata</i></a>
in those points, namely, in its membranous basis and transversely elongated
scuta, in which it differs from all the other species, and, moreover,
in its scuta not being plainly striated longitudinally, in having more ribs
on the external surface of the parietes of its shell, and in having only
three pairs of main spines on the three posterior cirri.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, of the usual sub-triangular shape, and not transversely elongated,
as in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>. External surface striated longitudinally;
in many specimens there is a medial depression, or a row of very small
pits, such as occur on the scuta of <a href="#Balanus_trigonus"><i>Balanus trigonus</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>lævis</i></a>. The
adductor ridge is moderately developed, and runs nearly parallel to
the occludent margin; there are no crests for the rostral and lateral
depressor muscles.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>: these in area equal two thirds of the scuta: the spur is short

<p><i>Structure of the Shell and Radii.</i>—The parietal tubes are small, and
very numerous, as in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>. The radii are wide, square on
the summits, but not so conspicuously covered by hirsute epidermis as
in that species. Internally, the tubes forming the radii are smaller,
and run more transversely than in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>, that is in the normal
course, as in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The edges of the alæ are nearly or quite
smooth. The <i>Basis</i> is as distinctly calcareous, as in the other species
of the genus.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: the trophi are not so hairy as in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>; the
labrum seems destitute of teeth; the palpi are club-shaped at their

cirri are not so short and blunt relatively to the others as in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>.
In the posterior cirri, the elongated segments carry four main
pairs of spines, between which there is no intermediate tuft of fine
spines.</p>

<p>The <i>Affinities</i> of this species have been fully pointed out under the

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, moderately steep: white, generally
with a tinge of pinkish-purple in the upper part, owing to the<a name="Page_341" id="Page_341" href="#Page_341"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 341]</span></a>
exposure of the tips of the upfilled parietal tubes. The lower part of
the surface is generally well preserved, and is formed by very irregular,
branching, longitudinal, slightly prominent, ridges. Radii of moderate
width, with their summits oblique. Orifice rather large, rounded
trigonal.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, rather narrow, with the upper part acuminated: the external
surface generally much disintegrated, and marked with some irregular
blotches of dark red. Articular ridge not prominent; articular furrow
rather deep: adductor ridge, distinct from the articular ridge,
pretty well developed, as are the crests for the rostral and lateral
depressor muscles. In young and well preserved scuta, there is an
external, medial, hyaline band, corresponding with the hollow under the
adductor ridge, and caused by the thinness of the valve along this line.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>: externally, the carinal half is longitudinally and very feebly
striated. Internally, the articular furrow is very wide, but shallow, and
of unusual length, owing to the preservation of the upper part of the
valve; the articular ridge is not prominent. The spur does not
actually join, as in all the foregoing species, the basi-scutal angle,
but is separated from it by a short piece of basal margin; its two
sides are more nearly parallel than is usual, and the end is regularly
rounded. It is always rather narrow, though the width varies
considerably (fig. <a href="#p11f03d">3 <i>d</i></a>, <a href="#p11f03e">3 <i>e</i></a>). It extends in the same straight line with
the middle of the articular furrow. The terga, though not possessing
any striking characters, differ considerably in appearance from those
of the other species.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Shell and Radii.</i>—The parietal tubes are remarkable
from their irregular shapes, and unequal sizes (fig. <a href="#p11f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>),—hardly two
resembling each other. Sometimes a single elongated tube will reach
across the whole thickness of the walls. The septa between the tubes are
rather thick and rugged. The tubes are generally darkly coloured from
the adhering corium; they are solidly upfilled, but only in the uppermost
part, by dark chocolate-red shelly matter. The radii are formed
by irregularly branching ridges, with the interspaces filled up solidly.
The square edges of the alæ are much thicker than in any other
species, and are furnished with transverse ridges, which are sometimes
slightly branched. The inner lamina of the walls near the basis, in
most of the specimens, is irregularly and longitudinally ribbed, the
ribs being longitudinally striated. The sheath and the upper part of
the inner lamina of the parietes are clouded with chocolate-red.</p>

<p>The animal's <i>Mouth</i> and <i>Cirri</i> were ill-preserved; but I was able to
make out that the labrum had some strong teeth, and that the mandibles
were furnished with five teeth, a greater number than in any
other species. The palpi had parallel sides as usual. In the sixth
cirrus, the segments had four pairs of main spines, instead of the usual
number of three.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species does not appear to be particularly related to
any other one: perhaps it is rather nearer to the two following than
to the foregoing species. The irregular parietal tubes, thick-edged
alæ, form of terga, five teeth to the mandibles, and four pairs of spines
to the segments of the posterior cirri, are its chief characteristics.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Hab.</i>—Philippine Archipelago, attached to <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>; attached
to a ship's bottom, and to <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a>, both from the Pacific Ocean;
attached to a massive coral, and associated with <a href="#Tetraclita_vitiata"><i>T. vitiata</i></a>, and therefore from
the tropical eastern seas; Mus. Brit., Cuming, Stutchbury.</p>

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, sometimes depressed; surface
with rather broad, smooth, longitudinal ridges; whitish, with the upper
part greenish-blue, sometimes very feebly tinted with pink; radii white,
or mottled with blueish-green, or with pink. When the outer lamina
of shell has been corroded, the upfilled parietal tubes, of a dull blueish-gray
colour, are exposed. The radii are moderately wide, with their
summits very oblique. In basal diameter, one specimen was 1.8, and
another 1.5 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, externally furrowed very slightly in a longitudinal direction,
causing the lines of growth to become a little sinuous. The valve is
strong and thick; and the epidermis, when preserved, is hirsute with
spines. The articular ridge is extraordinarily prominent; it projects, as
measured from the external surface of the valve, to an amount equalling
half the width of the valve in its widest part. The adductor ridge is
very short, and is united to the bottom of the articular ridge, thus
forming a small, nearly cylindrical tube, which runs up to near the apex
of the valve. The inflected occludent margin is broad and coarsely
toothed. The crests for both depressor muscles are not very prominent.
When the scuta and terga are articulated together, owing to the
great projection of the articular ridge of the scutum, its upper part is
separated from the tergum (fig. <a href="#p11f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>), by a remarkably wide and deep,<a name="Page_343" id="Page_343" href="#Page_343"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 343]</span></a>
fissure-like hollow. The scutum, in some distorted specimens from a
ship's bottom, was narrow in proportion to its ordinary breadth.</p>

<p><i>Terga.</i>—These are large. Externally, there is a broad, longitudinal
depression, bounded on each side by a ridge. The carinal half is
feebly striated longitudinally. A large upper portion (fig. <a href="#p11f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>) projects
freely, and stands, when the two valves are articulated together,
above the apex of the scutum, but does not form a beak as in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T.
porosa</i></a>. Internally, the tergal margin is widely inflected; the articular
furrow is very deep, but the articular ridge is not prominent. The
spur is not very broad; it is separated from the basi-scutal angle by a
small space of basal margin, which forms a straight line with the basal
margin on the opposite side of the spur. The end of the spur is truncated,
and is parallel to the basal margin.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Shell and Radii.</i>—The walls are thick: the parietal
tubes are rather large and regular; they become solidly filled up in their
upper parts. The sutural edges of the radii are formed by unusually
narrow, sinuous ridges, sending off delicate denticuli on each side: the
interspaces between these ridges are solidly filled up. The crenated
edges of the alæ are rather thick. Neither the <i>mouth</i> nor the <i>cirri</i>
offer any noticeable character; but I may observe, that, in the mandibles,
the third and fourth teeth are close together; and that, in the
three posterior cirri, the tufts of small spines between the main pairs
are small.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species is very distinct from the others, with the
exception of the following <a href="#Tetraclita_radiata"><i>T. radiata</i></a>, to which it is in several respects
allied. The under side of the scutum, with its great articular ridge,
and the cylindrical tube formed by the union of the latter with the short
adductor ridge, affords the most noticeable character.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_112_112" id="Footnote_112_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> The synonymy of this species is complicated. De Blainville gives no description
under the article Conia, published in 1818, or in the vol. published in
1822; but I believe, from the figures of the opercular valves, that I have correctly
identified this species with his <i>C. radiata</i>. Mr. Sowerby gives no description of
<i>C. Lyonsii</i>, or any figure of the opercular valves, but his drawing of the shell
is much better than de Blainville's, and I believe it is the same species.
Whether de Blainville's or Sowerby's plate appeared first I cannot ascertain.
In the second edition of Lamarck, <i>Conia radiata</i> of Blainville is given
as a synonym to <i>Balanus radiatus</i> of that work; but this is quite erroneous.
I may add that if de Blainville's name does not apply to the present
species, it must to <a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>T. cœrulescens</i></a>, and as the latter is the older name it will be
permanent. In this case, <a href="#Tetraclita_radiata"><i>T. radiata</i></a> might be allowed to stand as my own
name, considering that Mr. Sowerby's figure is imperfect and is not accompanied
by any description. At first I thought that the present species might
be the <i>Lepas mitra</i> of Spengler, ('Skrivter af Naturhist. Selskabet,' 1790,
Tab. 6, fig. 5), but the parietes are not described as porose; and the folds on
the walls are too broad; on the other hand, his description of the opercular
valves makes me think this may be the same species.</p>

tintinnabulum</i> on ships' bottoms; Mus. Brit., Stutchbury, and Cuming.</p>

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell white, rather steeply conical, with
numerous, approximate, rather narrow, longitudinal, rounded ribs on
the walls: in a specimen half an inch in diameter, there were from eight
to twelve ribs on each compartment. The outer lamina of shell seems
always well preserved. Orifice rounded, trigonal. Radii white,
smooth, broad, with their summits only slightly oblique. I have seen
one specimen 1.2 in basal diameter, but quarter of an inch is a
common size, and very young specimens are unusually frequent in
collections.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i> broad, externally not striated longitudinally. The articular
ridge is prominent, and the furrow deep, but not in so great a degree
as in <a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>T. cœrulescens</i></a>. The adductor ridge is only slightly prominent; it
extends upwards only a little way above the lower end of the articular
ridge, and does not form with the latter a cavity. There are no crests
for the rostral depressor muscle, but there is a little pit, formed by the
folding over of the occludent margin.</p>

<p><i>Terga.</i>—These valves, when articulated with the scuta (fig. <a href="#p11f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>), project
above them to an extraordinary degree, and are separated from
them by a deep, fissure-like hollow, caused by the remarkable prominence
of the articular ridge of the terga. The upper part of the
tergum is not beaked, and does not project freely much above the sack.
The valve is large; externally there is a rounded longitudinal furrow.
The tergal margin is broadly inflected. The articular furrow is deep,
and the articular ridge far more prominent than in any other sessile
cirripede, for it projects, as measured from the outside surface, more
than half the width of the valve; and consequently the valve, when
viewed vertically from above, almost appears as if formed by the union
of three plates, viz., the articular ridge, and the outside surface on
each side of the spur. The spur is of moderate width, with the
corners rounded: it is placed near, but not close to the basi-scutal
angle, so that there is on this side a small portion of basal margin,<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345" href="#Page_345"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 345]</span></a>
forming nearly a straight line with the margin on the carinal side. In
some young specimens, about the tenth of an inch in diameter, from
the West Indies and from New South Wales, the spur (the position of
which I found varied a little in some other specimens) was placed
nearly in the middle of the valve, and very nearly at right angles to the
basal margin; it is possible that these may be a distinct species, but
without larger specimens to judge from, I think it more probable that
this difference in the tergum is due to variation and youth.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell and Radii.</i>—The parietal tubes are commonly
elongated in the ray of the circle: the septa are rather thick, and
strongly crenated at their basal edges. The inner lamina of the walls
is strongly ribbed longitudinally. The broad radii have their sutural
edges formed by ridges, with numerous and closely approximate denticuli:
the interspaces between the main ridges are not soon filled up,
and at the bottom, each interspace usually terminates in a pore or
tube; so that the radii are not solid, as in most of the foregoing species,
but porose. The alæ have their edges crenated.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i>, calcareous, of unusual thickness; the inner, or upper surface,
is striated from the centre in rays, corresponding with the ribs on
the inner lamina of the walls. This striated or furrowed structure in
the basis, shows a tendency to its becoming tubular or porose, as may
be inferred from analogous cases in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>.</p>

<p><i>Animal's body</i> unknown.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species is rather more closely allied to the last than
to any other. There is a close analogy in the peculiar manner in which
the scuta and terga are articulated together in the two species: in
this species it is effected by the great development of the articular ridge
of the tergum, and in <a href="#Tetraclita_coerulescens"><i>T. cœrulescens</i></a> by that of the scutum. The internally
striated calcareous basis, and the internal tubular interspaces
between the denticulated ridges of the radii, are peculiar characters.
The white colour, the narrowly and closely ribbed parietes, and the
broad radii, give this species an aspect, by which it can be easily
recognised.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, with a strong tendency
in most of the species to become cylindrical: orifice<a name="Page_346" id="Page_346" href="#Page_346"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</span></a>
generally large. Walls either thin and smooth, or thick
and plicated longitudinally. Colours various, pale purple,
greenish, white, and, in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>, owing to the exposure
of an intermediate lamina of shell, bright orange-yellow.
Radii, either of considerable width, with their summits
oblique and rounded, as in the first two species of the
genus, or very narrow, as in the last two species. <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>Elminius
plicatus</i></a> is the largest species, and is sometimes one inch in
basal diameter. The outer surface of this latter species is
occasionally much corroded.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: these are of the usual shape; in <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a> and
<a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>modestus</i></a> there is no adductor ridge and no crests for the
depressor muscles; in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a> and <a href="#Elminius_simplex"><i>simplex</i></a>, on the other
hand, there is a well developed adductor ridge and crests
for the lateral depressor muscles; in some individuals, also,
of <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a> there are small crests for the rostral depressores.</p>

<p>The <i>Terga</i> are remarkable for their variability in all the
species; in many specimens of <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a> and <a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>modestus</i></a> the
basal margin on the carinal side of the spur is deeply hollowed
out. The width and acumination of the spur varies
in all the species. In <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a> and <a href="#Elminius_simplex"><i>simplex</i></a> this valve is
remarkably like that of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a>. In some specimens
of <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a> the terga and scuta are firmly calcified together.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Parietes and Radii.</i>—As in <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>,
the two lateral compartments are necessarily broad. The
parietes are never porose, but consist, in appearance, of a
single layer of shell. In <a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>E. modestus</i></a> the basal internal edges
of the parietes are smooth, but in the other species they are
striated longitudinally with short ridges, or sometimes with
sub-cylindrical projections. In those specimens of <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E.
plicatus</i></a>, which have externally suffered much corrosion, the
walls have been rendered extremely thick, by the inward
production of these ridges or plates; and in this case the
ridges are not confined to the basal edges, but extend
upwards close to the sheath. The basal surfaces of the walls
in these latter specimens resemble those of <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, but
the walls in that genus have an internal lamina, which here
is not the case. The radii are wide in <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a>, and of moderate
width in <a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>E. modestus</i></a>, with their summits oblique and
smoothly rounded, and their sutural edges not in the least<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347" href="#Page_347"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 347]</span></a>
crenated. In <a href="#Elminius_simplex"><i>E. simplex</i></a> they are extremely narrow, smooth-edged,
and rounded: in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a> they are narrow, and in
this species alone the sutural edge is sinuous, and sends
inwards short ridges or teeth. The alæ, in all the species
except this last, are likewise smooth-edged. The lower edge
of the sheath depends, more or less freely, in all the species,
except in <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i>, membranous in all four species. In <a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>E. modestus</i></a>,
the true basal membrane is extremely thin, and is divided into
concentric slips: on its inner surface there are attached
numerous cement-ducts, varying from 1/3000 to 1/2000 of an inch
in diameter, repeatedly trifurcating, rarely forming hexagonal
or quadrangular loops, and with the branches placed approximately
parallel to each other. Beneath the true basal
membrane there is a complicated layer of cement, in the
form of a <span class="correction" title="In the original book: net-work">network</span>, or of separate tubes, or in beads and
patches. In <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a>, the basal membrane presented a
wonderfully complicated appearance, in part due to the
cement forming a mass of inosculating fibres; many of
these fibres seemed to end in circular discs of cement.</p>

<p>Neither the <i>Mouth</i> or <i>Cirri</i> offer any noticeable generic
characters, as distinct from <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> and several other genera.
The <i>Branchiæ</i>, in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>, are well developed and moderately
plicated. In <a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>E. modestus</i></a> they are small, not
plicated, but with a rounded sinuous margin: in a specimen
having a basal diameter of 25/100, the branchiæ in total
length were only 4/100 of an inch. At the bottom of the sack
I observed some inwardly pointed, tapering filaments, such
as occur in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. In this same species I measured the
ova, which were unusually elongated, being 19/2000 in length; I
may add, that the probosciformed penis was actually thrice
the length of the animal's body in some small but mature
specimens (with ova), having a shell with a basal diameter
of 16/100 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Distribution and Habitats.</i>—This genus is remarkable, inasmuch
as it is not distributed over the whole globe: three
of the species occur very commonly on the shores of New
South Wales, Van Diemen's Land, and New Zealand; not
extending, as far as I can judge, much north of Sydney:
the fourth species is confined to South America, ranging<a name="Page_348" id="Page_348" href="#Page_348"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 348]</span></a>
from the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego, as far
north as Chiloe. <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>, therefore, appears to be strictly
a southern genus. <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>Elminius Kingii</i></a> and <a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>modestus</i></a> represent
each other on the American and Australian continents; so I
believe <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>, in New Zealand, represents <a href="#Elminius_simplex"><i>E. simplex</i></a>
in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. The species
are all attached to tidal rocks and shells. <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a> is sometimes
attached to floating wood. At the Falkland Islands,
the last-mentioned species adhered to some rocks, in a
running brook of fresh water, at most eighteen inches under
high-water mark, so that for the greater part of each tide it
was exposed to absolutely fresh water. At Sydney I found
<a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>E. modestus</i></a> adhering to oysters in a muddy lagoon, almost
separated from the sea, and apparently very unfavorable
for cirripedes.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This genus can be distinguished from <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>
only by the four compartments not being porose, and
by the basis being always membranous; whereas, in <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>Tetraclita
purpurascens</i></a> alone it is membranous. <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>Elminius Kingii</i></a>
and <a href="#Elminius_modestus"><i>modestus</i></a>, on the one hand, are closely allied together,
as are <a href="#Elminius_simplex"><i>E. simplex</i></a> and <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>plicatus</i></a> on the other hand. The last-named
species, in the characters of its opercular valves and
in its shell, comes nearest to <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>. In <a href="#Tetraclita_rosea"><i>T. rosea</i></a> we have
seen that there is only a single row of parietal tubes, and
the outer lamina of the shell is strengthened (as, indeed, it
is in most of the other species of the genus, and in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>)
by small longitudinal plates or ridges, which are similar and
homologous to those on the internal basal edges of the parietes
in three of the species of <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>; so that the difference
in the structure of the parietes, in <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> and <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>,
is small.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell fragile, either steeply conical with a
large orifice, or sub-cylindrical; surface smooth, grayish or white, with
large portions covered by pale brown epidermis. Radii broad with
their summits oblique, smooth, slightly arched, exhibiting a large surface
of the alæ. The alæ usually have their summits much less
oblique than those of the radii; the portion added during diametric
growth is of a dead white colour. The growth ridges on the scuta are
very little prominent, and are crossed by a very obscure band of
blueish-gray. The largest specimen which I have seen was .8 in basal
diameter, and the longest cylindrical variety .55 of an inch in height.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> are remarkable for not having any adductor ridge or
crests for the depressor muscles; the articular ridge is prominent, but
it is short, not extending down half the valve. I have mentioned
under the genus, that in many specimens at the Falkland Islands the
scuta and terga were calcified together.</p>

<p>The <i>Terga</i> are rather small: the basal margin on the carinal side of
the spur is always hollowed out, but to a very variable degree, as may
be seen in the three figures (<a href="#p11f06c">6 <i>c</i></a>-<a href="#p11f06e">6 <i>e</i></a>); this margin is generally dentated
with one or two little points; and an inner lamina of shell sometimes
depends beneath the outer lamina, to which the opercular membrane
is attached, as may be seen in the figure (<a href="#p11f06d">6 <i>d</i></a>) of the external surface
of the valve. The crests for the depressor muscles are well developed.
The tergal margin is broadly inflected, and the articular ridge prominent,
making the articular furrow deep. The spur is rather narrow,
and is either (<a href="#p11f06d">6 <i>d</i></a>, <a href="#p11f06e">6 <i>e</i></a>) bluntly or sharply pointed. The basal margin
on the scutal side of the spur, is hollowed out, but to a variable
depth.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Parietes and Radii.</i>—The parietes are thin; at their
internal basal edges they are finely striated in longitudinal lines. The
radii are solid, with quite smooth edges; they are generally covered
by the epidermis. The sutural edges of the alæ are likewise smooth,
these are added to largely during the diametric growth; and their
summits, as already stated, are much less oblique than the summits of
the radii. The internal surface of the shell is smooth, and is tinted
pale dull purple. The lower edge of the sheath can hardly be said to
be free. The carinal margins of the compartments project a little
inwards.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: the labrum is deeply notched, and supports five little teeth
on each side; the palpi are thickly clothed with spines on their inner
sides; the mandibles have five or only four teeth: the maxillæ are
notched, and the outer maxillæ bilobed.</p>

<p><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350" href="#Page_350"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 350]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Cirri</i>: the first pair has one ramus nearly twice as long as the other.
The three posterior cirri are elongated, and each segment supports five
or six pairs of long spines, with a few minute intermediate bristles.</p>

</div>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, generally rather steep, occasionally
depressed: walls longitudinally folded, sometimes very deeply,
sometimes only to a slight degree: colour dull greenish or white.
Radii of moderate width, with their summits very oblique, smooth and
slightly arched: alæ much exposed, with their summits less oblique
than those of the radii: the portion added to the alæ during the diametric
growth differs much in appearance from the other portion. The
scuta have the growth ridges but little prominent; they are crossed by
a faint longitudinal band of gray. The largest specimen out of the
many which I have seen, was under .4 of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, destitute of an adductor ridge and of crests for the depressor
muscles: the articular ridge is moderate; but the articular furrow is
rather wide: the internal occludent margin is much thickened. The
<i>Terga</i> are narrow and small; they are somewhat variable in shape,
caused by the degree to which the basal margin is hollowed out (fig. <a href="#p12f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>-<a href="#p12f01e">1 <i>e</i></a>),
and likewise by the extent to which the upper end of the valve
has been worn away. No spur is apparent, for it is confluent with the
basi-scutal angle of the valve. The articular ridge is very prominent,
and runs down to the basi-scutal angle; and as the valve in this part is
extremely narrow, with the spur not developed, it here assumes a channelled
structure. The basi-carinal corner of the valve is furnished
with rather feeble crests for the depressor muscles, and in those varieties
in which the basal margin is much hollowed out, this part is
remarkably narrow.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Parietes and Radii.</i>—The internal basal edges of
the parietes and the sutural edges of the radii and alæ, are all smooth.
The lower edge of the sheath depends freely. In the green varieties
the colour is most distinct on the internal surface of the shell. The
four compartments separate very easily when the shell has been ill preserved
in spirits, or after a very short immersion in caustic potash.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>, as in <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a>, excepting that there are only three teeth
on each side of the notch (which is deeper) on the labrum. The<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351" href="#Page_351"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 351]</span></a>
cirri resemble those of <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a>; the segments in the sixth pair are
equally elongated, and bear five or six pairs of spines.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species is closely allied to its South American representative
<a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a>; the differences consist in its smaller size,
often greenish colour, more folded walls, and narrower radii: the
internal basal edges, also, of the parietes are here smooth, instead of
being striated, as in <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>E. Kingii</i></a>. The terga present even more obvious
differences, in their narrowness, channelled under surface, and in the
absence of the spur, or more properly in its confluence with the basi-scutal
angle of the valve.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell tubulo-conical, or conical, rarely depressed;
strong, rugged, coloured in parts bright orange; deeply
plicated longitudinally, but with the upper parts corroded and smooth.
Orifice large. The sutures are indistinct and almost obliterated; the
radii, when most developed, are narrow. Some specimens have their
whole surface deeply corroded; in which case they are finely striated
longitudinally, or pitted, and are of a gray or brown colour. The
largest specimens are one inch in basal diameter, but one depressed
specimen was 1.3 in diameter; another was rather under one inch in
diameter, and one inch in height.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>; beginning with the common tubulo-conical and not much corroded
specimens, the valve (fig. <a href="#p12f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>) is moderately elongated, but in a
rather variable degree. A prominent adductor ridge runs, from a little
above a middle point of the basal margin, along the slightly prominent
articular ridge: the articular furrow is moderately wide. There are
distinct crests for the lateral depressores. In the conical, corroded
specimens, the scuta (fig. <a href="#p12f02e">2 <i>e</i></a>) are considerably broader, with the articular
ridge much more prominent, and the furrow wider: in one such
specimen, there were crests for the rostral depressor muscle.</p>

<p>The <i>Terga</i>, in the commoner variety, resemble those of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita
porosa</i></a>; the spur adjoins the basi-scutal angle of the valve: the articular
ridge is moderately prominent, and the furrow moderately deep.
The valve is beaked, with an unusually large internal tube for the
thread of corium: the beak, however, is often worn away. In the
depressed much corroded specimens, the terga (fig. <a href="#p12f02f">2 <i>f</i></a>), like the scuta,<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352" href="#Page_352"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 352]</span></a>
are broader and shorter than in the commoner variety; and the spur
more especially is broader. The scutal margin is much more widely
inflected, and the articular ridge much more prominent; consequently
the articular furrow is much deeper.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the parietes and radii.</i>—The orange or yolk-of-egg
colour, which is so conspicuous a character in the present species, is
due to a layer of shell between the inner and outer lamina, and is exposed
only by the corrosion of the latter. Hence the very base of the
shell is not of this colour; nor are the uppermost and still more deeply
corroded portions, for here the orange-coloured layer has been removed.
The sheath is orange-coloured, and the operculum, to a certain extent,
is similarly tinted. The epidermis on the parietes, where preserved
quite close to the basis, supports remarkably strong spines, about 1/100th
of an inch in length. The basal internal edges of the walls are rather
coarsely striated with irregular short ridges and sub-cylindrical points;
and the walls in most of the specimens are regularly and deeply folded,
which, with the little ridges, gives the appearance represented in fig.
<a href="#p12f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_696">12</a>. I have stated, under the Genus, that in the corroded and
depressed specimens, the walls are rendered extremely thick by the inward
production and upward extension of these same ridges and points;
the under surface of the shell acquiring almost the appearance of <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>Chelonobia
caretta</i></a>. The Radii are often not developed, even the sutures
being obscure; when most developed, they are narrow, with the outer
lamina along the growing edge sinuous, giving to the sutures a crenated
appearance. The sinuosities on the growing edge generally send
inwards short ridges or septa, like those on the sutural edges of the radii
in most <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, but of which there is no trace in the other species of
<a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>. In very minute, colourless specimens, about the 1/20th of an
inch in diameter, the radii are quite smooth-edged. The alæ have their
edges strongly crenated. The lower edge of the sheath depends freely.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: the labrum shows some tendency to be bullate; the notch
is broad and shallow: the palpi have a thick brush of bristles on their
inner sides. The mandibles have four or five teeth. In the maxillæ,
the upper spines above the broad notch, are very strong. In the
outer maxillæ, the two lobes are widely separated.</p>

<p><i>Cirri</i>: in the first pair, one ramus is about one fifth longer than the
other. In the third pair, the posterior ramus is one fourth longer
than the anterior ramus, and its terminal segments are tapering, each
having a single circle of bristles: the other segments, and those of the
shorter ramus, support many coarsely pectinated spines. In the sixth
cirrus, the segments are protuberant in front, and carry four pairs of
stout spines, with a tuft of fine bristles between them.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This species differs considerably from the first two of the
genus. In several characters it approaches nearer than the other
species to <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, especially to <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>T. porosa</i></a>;—namely, in the scutum
having an adductor ridge and crests for the lateral depressores, in the
whole form of the tergum, in the thick walls liable to much corrosion, in
the narrow radii, and in their edges, as well as those of the alæ, being
crenated; and, lastly, in the character of the cirri, more especially of
the third pair, with its coarsely pectinated spines. It also approaches,
in all its characters, <a href="#Balanus_Imperator"><i>Balanus imperator</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_flosculus"><i>flosculus</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">This species, of which I have seen specimens from the
above three localities, all exactly agreeing with each other,
is perhaps the Australian representative of <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>,
which seems to be confined to New Zealand.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[113]</span></a> In all

make the greater part of my description comparative.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_113_113" id="Footnote_113_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_113_113"><span class="label">[113]</span></a> I am bound to state that I have seen <span class="correction" title="In the original book: too">two</span> specimens of <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a> marked
Sydney, and one marked Moreton Bay, but in both cases the collectors had
visited New Zealand, so that a wrong habitat by mistake might easily have got
attached to the specimens in question.</p></div>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—In external appearance there is considerable
difference from <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>, for <a href="#Elminius_simplex"><i>E. simplex</i></a> is generally of a regular
conical shape, of a dirty-white colour, with the surface well preserved,
having moderately wide, not very prominent longitudinal ribs. The
orifice is rather small and pentagonal. The radii are extremely narrow
or linear, with quite smooth edges; the sutures, however, are always
very distinct, and in the upper part, the alæ are generally rather widely
exposed, as viewed from the outside. The largest specimen which I
have seen was .7 of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>opercular valves</i> are closely similar to those of <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>, but
the <i>scutum</i> is generally a little more elongated, and the articular furrow
not so deep: in accordance with this last fact, the articular ridge in the
<i>tergum</i> is not so prominent as in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>; but we have seen that
these several characters are highly variable in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>. The slope
of the basal margin of the tergum towards the spur varies in the present
species, in a strictly analogous manner, as it does in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita
porosa</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Parietes and Radii.</i>—The parietes are not so thick
as in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>; internally they are tinted pale purple; when broken
transversely, a row of microscopically minute orange-coloured dots
can generally be distinguished between the outer and inner laminæ;
and these evidently represent the orange-coloured layer in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>.
The sheath also exhibits a faint tinge of orange. The radii are very<a name="Page_354" id="Page_354" href="#Page_354"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 354]</span></a>
narrow, and are quite smooth-edged, differently from in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>.
The edges of the alæ barely exhibit a trace of being crenated.</p>

<p>In the body I could perceive no difference from <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>, excepting
that in the third pair of cirri the two rami are like each other,
and do not support any coarsely pectinated, only serrated, spines; but
after what we have seen on the variability of these very same characters
in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a>, I dare not trust to them. The three posterior
pairs of cirri, also, seem here to be more elongated in proportion to
the others, than in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—It is certain that this species is most closely allied to
<a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>; but as I have seen many specimens of the latter brought
by different persons from New Zealand, and as I have observed in them
no approach to the characters of <a href="#Elminius_simplex"><i>E. simplex</i></a>, which, in specimens from
three localities, also appear to be constant, I have considered the two
forms as specifically distinct. The present species differs from <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>,
in its white, conical, moderately ribbed, well preserved, smaller
shell; and more especially in the orange-coloured intermediate lamina
of <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a> being here represented only by microscopically minute
dots. But the radii being smooth-edged, is the most important differential
character, though in <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>E. plicatus</i></a>, during its earliest growth,
whilst still immature and colourless, the radii are likewise smooth-edged.</p>

<p class="p2">I feel no hesitation in including the above several genera
in one genus. In external appearance the <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a>
(Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f05a">5 <i>a</i></a>), which forms the genus Daracia of Gray, is
the most distinct, but it is so intimately allied to the two,
indeed to the three, foregoing species, that it cannot be
separated from them. Of the first five species, <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a>, <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>conjugatum</i></a>,
and <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>cancellatum</i></a>, form a graduated series, but with
the steps very distinct, the chief difference being in the length
of the spur of the tergum; for the fact of the scutum and tergum
being calcified together in <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a> and <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>conjugatum</i></a>,
and distinct in <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>P. cancellatum</i></a>, is certainly unimportant, as
may be inferred from what we shall see in comparing together
the last four species of the genus, and from what we shall see
in <a href="#Creusia_spinulosa"><i>Creusia spinulosa</i></a>. The three above-mentioned graduated
species are connected with the last four species of the genus,
by several points of resemblance between <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a> and
<a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>crenatum</i></a>. The first two species, namely, <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a> and
<a href="#Pyrgoma_Stokesii"><i>Stokesii</i></a>, are the most closely related together, and may indeed
possibly be identical; these two, in all the characters
derived from the opercular valves, resemble <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> and
other ordinary forms, and for this very reason they have
some claims to be generically separated from the other
species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>; for in these latter, the opercular valves
seem to have broken loose from all law, presenting a greater
diversity in character than do all the other species of <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>
and <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a> taken together.</p>

<p><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shell consists of a single
piece, generally without any suture, even on the internal
surface; and this is the case, at least in <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a>, in
extremely young colourless specimens: nevertheless, in
some specimens of this very species, and of <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>P. conjugatum</i></a>,
there were traces of two, but only two, sutures on the
sheath, one on each side towards its carinal end. The shell
is much depressed or actually flat; and I have seen specimens
even slightly concave; in <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a>, however, the
shell is steeply conical. The outline is generally oval;
but in <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a> it is extremely irregular. The
surface is generally furnished with more or less prominent
ridges, radiating from the orifice, which is oval and small;
sometimes, as in <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a>, excessively small. The<a name="Page_356" id="Page_356" href="#Page_356"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 356]</span></a>
colour is white, or pinkish-purple. Most of the species are
small, but I have seen specimens of <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a> three quarters
of an inch in diameter in the longer axis, and, including the
deep, almost tubular, basis, more than three inches in length
or depth.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves.</i>—In three species, viz., <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>P. conjugatum</i></a>,
(Pl. <a href="#Page_696">12</a>, fig. <a href="#p12f07c">7 <i>c</i></a>), <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>grande</i></a>, and <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>monticulariæ</i></a>, the scuta and
terga, on each side, are calcified together so perfectly, that
there is no trace of a suture or line of junction: in <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a>,
these valves are generally slightly calcified together,
but with the suture distinct. The <i>Scuta</i> differ so much in
shape in the different species, that little can be said of them
in common: in <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a> and <a href="#Pyrgoma_Stokesii"><i>Stokesii</i></a> they resemble
those of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>; but in the other species they are much
more elongated than is usual, and this is carried to an extreme
in the last four species; this elongation is due to a great
increase in breadth, as may be inferred from the position
of the apex of the valve, and from the direction of the lines of
growth. But the two most remarkable characters are, first,—the
extraordinary development of the adductor ridge, so that,
in <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>P. conjugatum</i></a>, <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>cancellatum</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_696">12</a>, fig. <a href="#p12f05c">5 <i>c</i></a>), <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>grande</i></a>, and
<a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>crenatum</i></a>, it extends considerably beneath the basal margin,
being produced, in the first two species, at the rostral angle,
into a point; at the tergal end of the valve, the adductor
ridge, when thus much developed, blends into the articular
ridge. The second very remarkable character is the addition
of a special ledge along the occludent margin of the scutum,
and along the carinal margin of the tergum, which I will call
the occludent ledges (<i>limbus occludens</i>), and which serve to
close the orifice leading into the sack. The occludent ledge
is small in <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a>, and is clothed with thick yellow spines,
giving it a brush-like appearance: in <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>P. crenatum</i></a> and
<a href="#Pyrgoma_dentatum"><i>dentatum</i></a> it is largely developed, the ledge on the scutum
being articulated with that on the tergum, as shown in
Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p13f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>,—the ledges being here and elsewhere
marked by little bristly points. In <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a>, however,
this ledge arrives at its maximum development (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>,
fig. <a href="#p13f05f">5 <i>f</i></a>), the rest of the valve (the scuta and terga being
here, as in <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a>, calcified together) being reduced to a
mere basal edge or border. Excepting for the adductor<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357" href="#Page_357"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 357]</span></a>
muscle, the depressions or crests for the other muscles, both
on the scuta and terga, are hardly developed.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>: these, as in the case of the scuta, differ so much
in shape in the several species, that little can be said of them
in common. In <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a> and <a href="#Pyrgoma_Stokesii"><i>Stokesii</i></a>, they are of the
normal shape; in <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>P. cancellatum</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_696">12</a>, fig. <a href="#p12f05d">5 <i>d</i></a>) this, to a
certain extent, is likewise the case, but the spur is produced
to a quite extraordinary length. In <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>,
fig. <a href="#p13f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>) there is no distinct spur, and the whole valve is
square. In <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a> (<a href="#p13f02f">2 <i>f</i></a>) there is no spur, and the valve
is arched and triangular. In <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>P. crenatum</i></a> the spur is broad,
rounded, and depressed (fig. <a href="#p13f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>), with the carino-basal portion
of the valve reduced to a mere border, barely distinguishable
from the great occludent ledge. In <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a>
there is no spur, and the whole valve forms a mere border
to the occludent <span class="correction" title="In the original book: lodge">ledge</span>; and, lastly, in <a href="#Pyrgoma_dentatum"><i>P. dentatum</i></a>, the valve
is extremely variable in shape (fig. <a href="#p13f03c">3 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p13f03d">3 <i>d</i></a>, <a href="#p13f03f">3 <i>f</i></a>), and on its
internal surface (fig. <a href="#p13f03g">3 <i>g</i></a>) there is an inwardly projecting,
most singular and anomalous, tooth. Hence we see how
wonderfully variable the terga are in this genus.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Walls.</i>—The shell consisting, as has
been stated, of a single piece, is generally thick. From
the close alliance between this genus and <span class="correction" title="In the original book this word was italicized."><a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a></span>, it is probable
that the shell, if examined immediately after the metamorphosis,
would be found to show traces of being formed
of four compartments. The walls are either solid or porose;
their basal margin is formed by strong crenated ridges, answering
to the longitudinal septa in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>; but these in
<a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a> are modified into a very irregular surface.
The internal surface of the shell is generally smooth, or only
slightly ribbed. The sheath has its lower edge free in <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P.
Anglicum</i></a> and <a href="#Pyrgoma_Stokesii"><i>Stokesii</i></a>, and in a slight degree in <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a>,
but in the other species it is closely attached to the walls.
In <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a> the sheath might easily be overlooked.
In <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a>, <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>grande</i></a>, and <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>crenatum</i></a>, it descends almost to
the basal margin of the depressed shell, and as the opercular
valves and membrane are attached to the lower edge of the
sheath, the animal's body necessarily comes to be almost
exclusively lodged in the cup-formed basis. In <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a>
and <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>conjugatum</i></a>, the lines of growth in the sheath are bent<a name="Page_358" id="Page_358" href="#Page_358"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 358]</span></a>
upwards on each side, at points corresponding with the line
of union between the scutum and tergum, in a manner I have
not seen in any other cirripede; and this sometimes gives the
appearance of two lateral sutures. I may here remark, that
the manner of growth in <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a> is almost the converse of
that in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, and other allied genera; for in
these latter, the basis increases in diameter, and the shell
chiefly in height; whilst in <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, the shell, from being
so flat, increases almost exclusively in diameter, whereas it
is the basal cup which is added to in height or depth.</p>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—This in all the species is more or less regularly
cup-formed or sub-cylindrical. In <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a> it penetrates
the coral to a surprising depth; in <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a> it is
irregular in outline, corresponding with the shell. The
basis is generally almost wholly imbedded in the coral; but
this is not the case with <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a>, in which the basis is
generally exserted, as it is in a slight degree in <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a>.
The shelly layer forming the basis, in most of the species, is
very thin, and is finely plicated owing to its edge folding
between the ridges or septa that form the basal edges of the
shell; this is very conspicuous in <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>P. cancellatum</i></a>. The basis
is not permeated by pores, except in <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a>. In some
sessile cirripedes a cleft, covered only by membrane, may be
observed all round between the lower edge of the shell and
the basis; a cleft of this nature is rather conspicuous in
<a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>P. crenatum</i></a>, so that small portions of the septa on the internal
surface of the walls can be seen from the outside. In
<a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a>, an analogous structure, developed to an
extreme degree, presents a very different and unique appearance;
the shell is nearly flat, and the smooth outer lamina
does not nearly reach to the circumference, a wide border
being thus left exposed, which is roughened (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f05a">5 <i>a</i></a>,
<a href="#p13f05c">5 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p13f05d">5 <i>d</i></a>, <a href="#p13f05e">5 <i>e</i></a>) by the exposure of the irregular septa. I have
not seen a fresh specimen, but there cannot be a doubt that
this border is properly covered by membrane.</p>

<p><i>Animal's Body.</i>—From some cause, perhaps from the
corals in which the species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a> are imbedded, long
remaining damp, the internal organs are generally badly
preserved. I have received, in spirits of wine, only <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P.
Anglicum</i></a>, but I have examined dry specimens, in a tolerable<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359" href="#Page_359"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 359]</span></a>
condition, of <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a> and <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>crenatum</i></a>. As neither the
mouth nor cirri, in these three species, offer any noticeable
characters, distinct from those in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> or <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>, my
ignorance of these organs in the other six species is not
important. In the above three species the labrum is deeply
notched, with about three teeth on each side of the notch,
except in <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a>, in which the number is six. In all,
the mandibles have five teeth, the two lower ones being small:
the maxillæ are not notched: the outer maxillæ are bilobed.
In the <i>Cirri</i>, the rami in the first pair are very unequal in
length, the segments being slightly protuberant in the shorter
ramus. On the segments of the posterior cirri there are
four pairs of spines in <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a>, and three pairs (of which
the second and third are short) in <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a>. At the dorsal
basis of the penis there is a small straight projecting point.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—The species (with the exception of the first
two) are much more distinct from each other, and more easily
determined than is usual with sessile cirripedes; it is, however,
quite useless to attempt naming the species without
disarticulating and cleaning the opercular valves. Although
these valves differ so greatly in some of the species from those
of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> and the allied forms, the genus itself, as a whole,
does not differ much, except in the shell not being divided
into compartments, and in the basis being cup-formed and
not generally permeated by pores,—these latter characters
being in common with <a href="#Sub-Genus_Acasta">Acasta</a>. With respect to the absence
of separate compartments, it should be remembered, that in
the same species of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> we have individuals with the
four compartments distinct and furnished with radii, and
other individuals without any trace of a suture externally,—the
outer lamina of shell (though not the inner) having become
completely confluent all round. At the commencement
of this description, when giving my reasons for uniting the
several proposed genera into one genus, I gave a sketch of
the affinities of the species: I have only to add, that the
following sub-genus <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a> is closely, perhaps too closely,
allied to <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>.</p>

<p><i>Geographical and Geological Distribution.</i>—Most of the
species are inhabitants of the hot coral-growing zones, in both
the eastern and western hemispheres, but more especially,<a name="Page_360" id="Page_360" href="#Page_360"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 360]</span></a>
as it would appear, in the East Indian Archipelago. From
the habits of the corals, most of the species must be inhabitants
of shallow water. <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>Pyrgoma Anglicum</i></a>, however, is
an inhabitant of deep water on the southern shores of England,
whereas at St. Jago, in the Cape de Verde Islands, I
myself collected it adhering to a Caryophyllia, within the
tidal limits. This same species existed on the shores of
England during the Coralline Crag period; and at this epoch
it attained a larger size than at present. Two species of the
genus, according to Sismonda, are found in the tertiary beds
of Piedmont. Mr. Stutchbury, who is so well acquainted
with recent cirripedes, informs me that he has for many
years examined fossil Secondary corals, in the expectation of
finding imbedded, species of this genus or of some allied
form, but without success. The same species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>
is by no means always confined to the same coral: I have
seen <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>P. crenatum</i></a> on four or five different corals, and <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P.
Anglicum</i></a> on at least three kinds: on the other hand, I have
seen <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a> only on the <i>Millepora complanata</i> (a
member, as I believe, of the vegetable kingdom), and <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a>
on a <i>Monticularia</i> from near Singapore.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell steeply conical, slightly compressed,
the lower part with rounded, approximate, radiating ribs: colour
dull purplish-red: orifice oval, small, and narrow. The basis is not
deeply conical, and occasionally is even flat. Generally it stands
exserted; but in the Coralline Crag specimens, it is almost wholly
imbedded. Externally it is furnished with ribs corresponding with
those on the shell. The largest recent specimen which I have seen,
from St. Jago, was .22 of an inch in basal diameter; but some few of
the British specimens are nearly as large, and one of the fossils from
the Coralline Crag a little larger.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> and <i>Terga</i> are of the ordinary shape of these valves in
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> and its allies. <i>Scuta</i> triangular, with the basal margin a little
curved and protuberant: adductor and articular ridges distinct from
each other, moderately prominent: there is a small hollow for the
lateral depressor muscle. <i>Terga</i> triangular, with the spur rather
narrow, moderately long, placed near, but not confluent with the basi-scutal
angle of the valve. The basal margin forms an angle rather
above a right angle with the spur. Internally, the articular ridge and
crests for the depressor muscles, feebly developed.</p>

<p><i>Internal Structure of the Shell and Basis.</i>—Internally, the shell is
ribbed more or less prominently. The lower edge of the sheath, which
is reddish, and extends far down the walls, seems always to project
freely. In several specimens there were on each side, at the carinal
end of the shell, a trace of a suture, which could be perceived only on
the sheath. The basis appears always to be permeated by minute tubes
or pores, though these are sometimes rather difficult to be seen.</p>

<p class="p2">This species comes so close to the last, that I am not sure
that I have acted rightly in retaining it, but I think that it
is distinct; and in this case, it is the representative, on the
other side of the Atlantic, of <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a> of our own side. It
will be sufficient to point out the few points of difference.
The shell is much more depressed, with the orifice oval,
larger, and not so narrow. It is apparently of a paler red,
and the radiating ribs perhaps not so prominent. The
basis offers the most important difference, being deeply
imbedded in the coral; and there is not the least appearance
of the thin shelly layer, of which it is composed, being
permeated by pores, as, we have seen, is always the case
with <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a>. As in this latter species, the sheath
here depends freely. The opercular valves are closely
similar; but in the scutum, the adductor ridge occupies a
rather more central position; and in the tergum, the basal
margin is more inclined towards, or forms a greater angle
with, the spur: these differences, by themselves, I consider
quite insufficient to characterise a species; but conjoined
with the flatter shell, the larger orifice, the more
deeply imbedded and non-porose basis, they may, I think,
be admitted as specific. In dimensions, this species seems
to attain a slightly larger size than <a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>P. Anglicum</i></a>, for several
specimens were .22 of an inch in diameter.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—Shell nearly flat, sometimes
tinted dull dirty purple, with the surface marked by slight, broad,
approximate ridges, the ends of which form considerable projections,
giving to the shell, when not too much encrusted by coral, a lobed
border. In young specimens (.15 of an inch in diameter) some of the
points projected half as much as the semi-diameter of the shell, giving
it a radiating appearance. The orifice is oval and rather small, but of
variable size. The shell is thick, and, near the outer lamina, is penetrated
by pores: the internal surface is smooth. The sheath (fig. <a href="#p12f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>)
extends down but a short distance from the orifice; it is closely attached
to the walls: the lines of growth, at a point on each side, bend a little
downwards (instead of upwards, as in the two following species), and
hence the lower edge of the sheath irregularly projects downwards on
each side. The basal cup, internally, is plicated, the hollows corresponding
with the projecting, longitudinal, parietal septa, which form
the lobed border of the shell. The largest specimen which I have seen,
was rather above .4 of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> and <i>Terga</i> are not calcified together: they are both much
elongated. <i>Scutum</i> (fig. <a href="#p12f05c">5 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p12f05e">5 <i>e</i></a>).—For the first time in the genus, or
indeed in the family, this valve presents a remarkable character in the
adductor ridge being immensely developed, so as to project far below
the ordinary basal margin. At the rostral end, it at first appears to project
even more than it really does, for the toothed occludent margin is
in fact a prolongation of the true valve, as distinct from the adductor
plate. Excluding this very narrow, prolonged, occludent margin, the
adductor plate projects for a length equalling the rest of the valve.
Along the tergal margin, the adductor plate is united to the articular
ridge; and at the rostral end, it is produced into a square tooth, whence
a square-edged ridge extends on the surface of the plate upwards to the
ordinary basal margin of the valve. The exact shape of this adductor
plate varies a little, as does the degree to which it is closely attached
to the ordinary basal edge of the valve. The valve, as distinct from

The articular ridge is very prominent.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i> extremely narrow, linear, consisting in chief part of the spur,
which is fully four fifths of the entire length. Externally (fig. <a href="#p12f05d">5 <i>d</i></a>) the
valve is furrowed, with the edges more or less folded in along the spur.
The upper or ordinary part of the valve is about one third wider than
the spur. The basi-carinal angle is sharp, owing to the basal margin
being a little hollowed out. A special plate of shell (fig. <a href="#p12f05f">5 <i>f</i></a>), hollow
under its basal edge, runs from the carinal margin to the articular
ridge, which latter is situated in the middle of the valve, and against<a name="Page_364" id="Page_364" href="#Page_364"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 364]</span></a>
which the articular ridge of the scutum abuts. The spur is central;
its end is bluntly pointed. The total length of the tergum rather exceeds
that of the scutum, the produced adductor ridge being included
in the latter.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—Shell white, or with a tinge of
purple; nearly flat, with moderately prominent, narrow, approximate
ridges, radiating from the orifice, which is oval, rather narrow, and not
very small. In the largest specimens the ridges are less prominent
than in the figure given. The walls are thick, and not at all porose:
the sheath extends down almost to the base of the shell, and its lower
edge is closely attached to the walls: on each side, towards the carina,
there is a trace of a suture, and the lines of growth on the sheath are
here a little upturned. The basis is deeply imbedded and internally
furrowed; the calcareous layer forming it, is thin. The largest specimen
was .4 of an inch in the longer diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> and <i>Terga</i> (fig. <a href="#p12f07b">7 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p12f07c">7 <i>c</i></a>), in all the specimens which I have
seen, are calcified together, with no trace of a suture. There is, however,
a slight furrow, which, I believe, marks the normal line of separation
between the two valves; and in the following description this is
assumed to be the case. The <i>Scutum</i> has the adductor ridge greatly developed,
so as to project below the ordinary basal margin to a distance as
great as the height of the valve. At the rostral end, this adductor
ridge or plate is produced into a point; and at the tergal end, it is
blended with the articular ridge, and united to the inner face of the<a name="Page_365" id="Page_365" href="#Page_365"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 365]</span></a>
tergum. That portion of the scutum which corresponds with the valve
in ordinary cases, and alone is externally visible as long as the operculum
is united by the opercular membrane to the sheath, is narrow,
with the basal margin considerably hollowed out: the occludent edge
is formed into thick teeth. The <i>Tergum</i> is elongated, rather exceeding
in length the scutum, the latter being measured from the apex to the
rostral projection of the adductor plate. The surface of the valve is
depressed in the line of the spur, with the basal end of the latter
bluntly pointed. A very slight flexure (fig. <a href="#p12f07c">7 <i>c</i></a>) on the basal margin
indicates where we may believe the spur to commence, showing that it
rather exceeds in length the whole upper part of the valve. The lines
of growth obscurely indicate a tendency to the formation of a slight
"occludent ledge" along the carinal margin. Traces are just visible
of crests for the attachment of the tergal depressor muscles.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>Appearance and Structure of Shell and Basis.</i>—The shell is conical,
though to a variable degree, and sometimes is much depressed. The
surface is smooth, with only traces of narrow approximate ridges. The
colour is white, often with a tinge of dark purple. The orifice is oval,
and moderately large. The shell and a small portion of the basis
usually stand exserted above the coral. The walls are of variable thickness;
when thick, the pores, by which they are permeated, are but<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366" href="#Page_366"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 366]</span></a>
little apparent; sometimes there is more than a single row of pores.
The points of the septa on the basal edge of the shell are small. The
internal surface of the shell is smooth. The sheath is closely attached
to the walls, and descends nearly to the basis; on each side its lines
of growth are slightly upturned. The basis is deeply cup-formed or
cylindrical, and in section oval like the shell; it penetrates the coral to
a very remarkable depth,—in one instance to three inches. The shelly
layer forming it, is thin, finely furrowed, and not permeated by pores.
This is the largest species in the genus; one specimen was three quarters
of an inch in its longer diameter, and above three inches in length.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> and <i>Terga</i> are calcified together, without any trace of a
suture; the line of junction can be inferred only from the analogy of
<a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>P. conjugatum</i></a>, in which species the valves have a more normal
character, and are separated by a slight furrow. It may be seen in the
figure (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>) of the right and left hand opercular valves,
viewed from vertically above in their proper relative positions, how abnormal
their appearance is, which is partly caused by the spinose
occludent ledges, presently to be described, but chiefly from the carinal
margins of the two terga not being straight and parallel, as in all other
cirripedes, and therefore not meeting each other, as is usual. In other
genera, only the upper part of the carinal margin of the two terga can be
opened for the exsertion of the cirri, the lower portion being united by
membrane; but here, I have little doubt, from the position of attachment
of the adductor muscle (fig. <a href="#p13f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>), so close to and almost on the
terga, that the whole length of the carinal margin of the two terga
is free or disunited for the protrusion of the cirri. This opening between
the two terga evidently cannot be closed, but is probably filled up,
and the animal thus protected, by the dorsal surfaces of the curled-up
cirri; such, I believe, being likewise the case with some pedunculated
cirripedes, as with Conchoderma. The <i>scutum</i> has a large adductor plate,
which extends some little way (namely, about one quarter of the height
of the valve), below the ordinary basal margin. This latter margin is
slightly sinuous, and a little hollowed out towards the tergal corner of
the valve. I believe that the ridge, which runs down to the basi-scutal
corner of the tergum, though appearing to be part of the scutum, really
belongs to the tergum. The adductor scutorum plate is not, as in the
last two species, produced into a point at the rostral angle; at the tergal
end it blends into the under surface of the tergum. The occludent
margin is coarsely toothed. Rather on the under side of this margin
and in the upper part, there is a narrow occludent ledge, which extends
up beyond the apex of the valve, and thence runs a little way along the
carinal margin of the tergum. This ledge is thickly clothed with
strong, yellowish-brown spines, and hence appears like a brush. It is
remarkable that the cavity for the adductor scutorum muscle is situated
almost on the tergum.</p>

<p>The <i>tergum</i> is of large size, and nearly square; it is, in appearance,
separated from the scutum by a ridge running up to the apex. The
basal margin forms a right angle with the carinal margin, along which
latter margin the lines of growth are upturned, and blend into the
occludent ledge, which is common to the two valves. There cannot be<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367" href="#Page_367"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 367]</span></a>
said to exist any spur, the whole basal margin being almost straight;
nevertheless, on close examination, the ridge which in appearance separate
the scutum and tergum, may, I think, be safely considered as one
side of the spur (which, it should be remembered, has in all ordinary
cases a longitudinal furrow or depression), and the other side of the
spur is, apparently, very feebly indicated by a slight flexure in the
middle of the basal margin. Hence, if the spur had been developed,
it would probably have been half as wide as the valve. There are no
crests for the tergal depressor muscles.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—The present species, with the last two, form an interesting
series. <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>Pyrgoma grande</i></a> and <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>conjugatum</i></a>, however, are more closely
allied to each other than to <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>P. cancellatum</i></a>. In the scutum, the whole
valve is least elongated, with the adductor plate least developed, in <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P.
grande</i></a>, and most elongated, with the adductor plate most developed,
in <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>P. cancellatum</i></a>. In the outline of the tergum the range of shape is
quite remarkable; in <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>P. conjugatum</i></a>, which stands between the other
two species, the spur is rather long, whereas in <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a> there is no
spur at all—a very unusual circumstance—and in <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>P. cancellatum</i></a>, at
the other end of this short series, the spur attains a length wholly
unparalleled in any other cirripede.</p>

Leach (?), as given in Chenu, 'Illust. Conch.,' Tab. 1, fig. 6. But I feel sure
that Leach has nowhere published this name; and it may be observed that Chenu
gives it with a mark of doubt. The shell in its imbedded state is only figured;
the opercular valves are not given; and no descriptive details are added. Under
these circumstances I have not adopted this name; I have, perhaps, been in
some degree influenced by the fact that this species, judging from the many
specimens examined by me, is never imbedded in madrepores, but exclusively
in millepores, so that Chenu or Leach's specific name of <i>Madreporarum</i> is
singularly inappropriate.</p></div>

narrow; the carinal end being rounded, and the rostral end narrower
and sharper,—this being the exact reverse of the usual shape of the<a name="Page_368" id="Page_368" href="#Page_368"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 368]</span></a>
orifice in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>. The walls are thick, and are formed of large
square tubes. The internal surface of the shell is smooth. The sheath
(fig. <a href="#p13f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>) is much more elongated than the shell, for at the rostral end
it extends to the basal margin, and at the carinal end nearly to it,
whereas on the two sides it is some way distant from the base. The
orifice is considerably out of the centre of the sheath, being placed
nearest to the carinal end. The sheath has its lower edge slightly
prominent or free; the lines of growth are neither turned up nor down
on the two sides, as in the last three species. When nearly full grown
the sheath is coloured dark purple, but when young it is white, hence
the upper part is white, surrounded by an oblong purple ring, and this
is surrounded by the white shell. The basal cup is deep, and internally
nearly smooth. The largest specimens were .3 of an inch in their longer
diameter. Great masses of the Millepora are absolutely studded with
this <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae">Pyrgoma</a>, with usually more specimens on one side of the plate or
branch than on the other. They stand in approximately parallel positions,
the broad or carinal ends of the orifices pointing upwards.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—The scuta and terga are closely united, and <i>are</i> often (perhaps
always) in some slight, though variable degree, calcified together;
and hence they often break, rather than separate, at the line of articulation.
The external fissure or line of junction between them (fig. <a href="#p13f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>)
is oblique to the longer axis of the scutum; in the uppermost part of
the valve it is sometimes almost obliterated. The two valves together are
nearly as long as the sheath, and consequently much longer than the
orifice of the shell. The scutum is much elongated, being fully four
times as broad as high. The valve narrows towards the rostral end, but
in a variable degree: the basal margin is hollowed out a little (but to
a variable amount), close to the basi-tergal corner. Along the occludent
margin a slip of the valve, widening downwards, is a little bent inwards,
and this inflected portion is separated from the rest of the surface
by a slightly angular ridge, running from the apex to near the rostral
angle. Internally, at the basi-tergal corner, a slight ridge, parallel
and close to the basal margin (and which can be seen only when the
basal edge of the valve is held upwards), represents the adductor ridge,
which we have seen so largely developed in the last three species, and
shall again see in <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>P. crenatum</i></a>. The articular ridge (fig. <a href="#p13f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>) is extremely
prominent, consisting of a more or less rectangular shoulder.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>: these are rather small compared to the scuta: they are
triangular and much arched: there is no trace of a spur. Internally
(fig. <a href="#p13f02f">2 <i>f</i></a>), the articular ridge is central: there are some vestiges of crests
for the depressor muscle.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This well-marked species, in the tendency of the opercular
valves to be soldered together, and in the remarkable absence of
a trace of a spur to the tergum, is allied to <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a>, but it is more

<p class="p2"><i>Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—Shell nearly flat, oval, white
or pink, with rather distant prominent ridges radiating from the moderately
large (for the genus) oval orifice. The ridges are often obscured,
and apparently sometimes almost obliterated by the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: incrusting">encrusting</span> coral.
Shell permeated near the outer lamina by short imperfect pores: internal
surface smooth: sheath inconspicuous, descending rather more
than half way down the walls; lower edge closely attached to the walls.
Basis deep. Diameter of largest specimen .3 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: these are elongated, but to a very variable degree, some
specimens being quite three times, and some barely twice as broad as
high. I observed this same variability in two sets of specimens, differing,
as we shall presently see, in the form of their terga: it depends
in part, but not wholly, on the varying width of the occludent ledge,
which is sometimes only a fourth, and sometimes half as high as the
rest of the valve. This is the first species in the genus in which the
occludent ledge—a structure peculiar to the genus—has been amply
developed. The basal margin of the valve is slightly sinuous, and a very
little hollowed out near the basi-tergal corner; it is also very slightly
reflexed, the reflexed portion being separated from the upper part of the
valve by a very slight depression or even furrow. I notice this slightly
reflexed portion, simply as indicating a well marked feature in the basal
margin of the following closely allied species. Internally (<a href="#p13f03g">3 <i>g</i></a>), the adductor
ridge is thick and slightly prominent, but does not descend<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370" href="#Page_370"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 370]</span></a>
beneath the basal margin: it blends into the articular ridge, which
here projects in a remarkable manner and degree (<a href="#p13f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p13f03e">3 <i>e</i></a>, <a href="#p13f03g">3 <i>g</i></a>), like a
rounded tooth. This tooth is in part a development of the occludent
ledge; it varies much in shape. The line of junction between the
scutum and tergum is nearly straight, and nearly at right angles to
their longer axes. In some specimens the scuta and terga are partially
calcified together.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>: in three sets of specimens the terga differed considerably,
but as in every other respect there was the closest resemblance, I do
not doubt that these are merely varieties. In all three, the valve is rather
small, irregularly sub-triangular in shape, and externally somewhat
convex; in all three, there is an occludent ledge, of variable width as
in the scuta; and in all three, there is an internal tooth-like projection,
of variable form, unlike anything I have seen in any other cirripede.
In the <i>first variety</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f03c">3 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p13f03g">3 <i>g</i></a>), the basi-carinal corner
of the valve is bluntly pointed, and a slight flexure separates this portion
of the valve from the other and scutal half, which latter thus
exhibits some tendency to be converted into a spur: on the internal
surface (<a href="#p13f03g">3 <i>g</i></a>) of this spur-like portion of the valve, there is a rather
long, sharp tooth, which projects rectangularly inwards; it is flattened
in a plane at right angles to the longer axis of the scutum and tergum
together: it cannot be seen from the outside. In the <i>second variety</i>,
the shape of the valve is not very different (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f03d">3<i>d</i></a>), excepting
that the flexure, separating the basi-carinal corner of the valve from
the spur, is deeper; but on the internal face of the spur, the tooth is
far broader than in the first variety, and is flattened quite differently,
viz., in a plane nearly parallel to the surface of the valve, and instead
of projecting rectangularly inwards, it depends beneath the basal edge
of the so-called spur, and can be seen from the outside. In the
<i>third variety</i> (fig. <a href="#p13f03f">3 <i>f</i></a>), the whole carinal end of the valve is cut off,
and there can hardly be said to be any trace of a spur, yet a slight
furrow apparently marks the line of separation between the basi-carinal
portion of the valve, here become very narrow, and the broad,
irregular part, which would have formed the spur had such been
developed: on the internal surface of the latter portion of the valve,
there is a very small, blunt, slightly flattened tooth, projecting inwards,
and more resembling that in the first than that in the second variety.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—Shell not distinguishable from
that of <a href="#Pyrgoma_dentatum"><i>P. dentatum</i></a>; nearly flat, oval, white, sometimes pale pink, with
rather distant prominent ridges radiating from the moderately large
oval orifice. Shell solid, or permeated near the outer lamina by short
imperfect pores: internal surface smooth. The sheath descends nearly
to the base of the walls; it is but little conspicuous, and its lower
edge is closely attached to the inner surface of the shell. Basis deep.
Diameter of largest specimen under .3 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: in this species the scutum is more abnormal than in any
other Cirripede in the whole family: this is owing both to the adductor
ridge descending far beneath the basal margin, and to the great
development of the occludent ledge; hence the middle and very narrow
portion of the valve alone answers to the scutum, as seen in other
genera. The whole valve, including the adductor ridge and the occludent
ledge, is narrow, being more than twice as broad as high; but the
proportional width varies, owing chiefly (as in the last species) to the
varying width of the occludent ledge. This ledge commences a little
way from the rostral point of the valve, and gradually widening, extends
to the apex, where it is either as high or twice as high as the rest of
the valve. It is articulated by a convex surface, and by a hollow on its
under side with the occludent ledge of tergum. The scutum cannot
be said to have any tergal margin; without, indeed, the articular
surface of the occludent ledge be thus called. The basal margin is
curved, and considerably reflexed, of which peculiarity we have seen
a vestige in the last species: the reflexion is not well shown, owing to
the foreshortening of the reflexed edge, in fig. <a href="#p13f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>: this reflexed edge
not being shown, causes the lines of growth to appear as if they ran
more transversely to the longer axis of the valve, than they really do;
for they run nearly as in the scutum (fig. <a href="#p13f03e">3 <i>e</i></a>) of <a href="#Pyrgoma_dentatum"><i>P. dentatum</i></a>. The
direction of these lines of growth is of importance, for they show that
the elongation of the scuta is due to an inordinate increase in their
breadth, as compared to the same valves in ordinary species. The
adductor ridge, having a sinuous margin, runs from near the apex to
near the rostral angle: it descends below the basal margin about as far
as the height of the true valve, excluding the occludent ledge. Of
course this adductor ridge or plate lies beneath the membrane connecting
the opercular valves with the sheath, and is concealed by it,
as long as these valves remain within the shell. The edge of the occludent
ledge is straight, but the edge of the middle portion of the
valve, that is of the true valve, is much bowed.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i> (fig. <a href="#p13f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>): these are of so irregular a shape that they can hardly
be described; they may, however, be said to consist of two portions
joined together, of which the lower portion is a little elongated transversely,
of somewhat variable shape, with part of its surface considerably<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372" href="#Page_372"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 372]</span></a>
depressed (compared with the rest of the valve), sometimes being even
concave: this concave portion apparently answers to the spur in other
cirripedes. At the scutal corner of the valve there is a shoulder (perhaps
answering to the inflected scutal margin in an ordinary tergum),
which locks into a hollow on the under side of the occludent ledge
of the scutum. The internal surface of the so-called spur is rounded
and convex. The upper part of the tergum is in main part formed
by a great occludent ledge; but this, on its lower side, is bordered
by a narrow irregular slip, which, as shown by the lines of growth,
represents the whole of the ordinary valve, excepting, of course, the
spur already described. The occludent ledges of both valves support
some fine spines.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—Observing how extraordinarily the terga varied in <a href="#Pyrgoma_dentatum"><i>P. dentatum</i></a>,
and that the shells were identical in that and the present species,
it occurred to me at first that they might, perhaps, be both extreme
varieties of one form: but in the scutum of <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>P. crenatum</i></a>, the invariably
great development of the adductor plate,—the marked manner in which
its basal margin is reflexed,—the absence of a tooth-like articular projection,—and
again in the tergum of <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>P. crenatum</i></a>, the invariably large
size of the concave spur, without any internal tooth, altogether convince
me that the two species must be considered as distinct. This
species is allied to <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a>, in the scutum of that species having an
occludent ledge, though small, and a great adductor plate. I have only
further to remark, that the figure of the opercular valves, given in
Sowerby's Genera of Recent and Fossil Shells, is so good, that there
can not be the least doubt about the present identification.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—Shell dull white, very irregular
in outline, sometimes rounded, more often unequally elongated,
and frequently star-shaped,—the projections being quite irregular.
Whole shell nearly flat, but with the central part saddle-backed, or
formed into a more or less prominent ridge, extending in the line of
the longitudinal axis of the animal's body: the circumferential portions<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373" href="#Page_373"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 373]</span></a>
of the shell not unfrequently are a little recurved upwards. Orifice
extremely minute, circular. The outer lamina of shell, which is
smooth, does not extend to the circumference, and consequently a
rather broad, nearly equal border, which is rough, surrounds the whole
shell. I have no doubt that, when the shell was alive, this border was
covered by a membrane, which, in drying, has curled up and been lost,
in the same manner as the strictly analogous but narrow open seam
between the basal edges of the shell and the basis in some cirripedes
(as in the last two species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma"><i>Pyrgoma</i></a>) is protected. The roughened
border can sometimes be plainly seen to be formed of normal (Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>,
fig. <a href="#p13f05e">5 <i>e</i></a>) longitudinal septa having crenated edges, with shorter septa
between the longer ones; but more often the septa are so irregular,
and so much branched (<a href="#p13f05d">5 <i>d</i></a>), that the whole resembles a mass of moss.
Why the outer lamina of the shell in this one species does not nearly
reach the circumference of the walls, I cannot conjecture. The extremely
irregular, depressed shape of the shell, with the minute circular
orifice, and the singular rough circumferential and often slightly
reflexed border, together give to this species so peculiar an aspect, that
until close examination I did not believe that it was a cirripede. The
extreme irregularity of shape depends in great part upon the irregular
growth of the Monticularia, in which it is imbedded.</p>

<p>Internally (fig. <a href="#p13f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>) the walls are smooth, but they are perforated by
many quite irregular, small orifices, which have the appearance of having
been formed by some boring animal, but really serve, as I believe, to
admit threads of corium into certain irregular pores which penetrate
the shell. The sheath descends but a very short distance from the
orifice: it is closely attached to the walls, and might easily be overlooked.
The basis is deep, of an irregular outline, like that of the shell,
and is formed by a very thin shelly layer. The largest specimen which
I have seen, measuring from the extreme projecting points, was .4 of
an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> and <i>Terga</i> (fig. <a href="#p13f05f">5 <i>f</i></a>) are calcified together without any
trace of a suture; together they form a bow with the two ends curled
rather abruptly inwards; they are both extremely narrow, but furnished
with an occludent ledge, twice or thrice as high as the proper valves
themselves. This occludent ledge, which is finely hirsute, begins at
about one third of the length of the scutum from the rostral angle, and
runs to near the basi-carinal angle of the tergum. The scutum itself
is curved, with a slip, along the true occludent margin (best seen at the
rostral end), lying in a different plane from the rest of the valve, much
in the same way as in the scutum of <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a>. The adductor ridge descends
a very little below the basal margin of the valve, and extends for
nearly its entire length: this adductor ridge makes the proper valve even
narrower than it at first appears. The <i>Tergum</i> is extremely narrow, forming
merely a border to the occludent ledge; but it is not short, being about
two thirds of the length of the scutum. There is no trace of a spur;
indeed, the valve is rather narrower where the spur should have stood,
than it is at the basi-carinal end. The scuta and terga are calcified
together by their apices.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—Although this species, as above stated, differs so remark<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374" href="#Page_374"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 374]</span></a>ably
in external appearance from the other species of the genus, and,
indeed, of the whole family, yet the shell in no one essential point of
structure materially differs from its congeners; and if we compare the
opercular valves with those of the three last species, we shall be struck
with their close, yet graduated, affinity: in <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a> the scuta and
terga tend to become calcified together, and the rostro-occludent end of
the scutum is bent into a different plane from the rest of the valve. In
<a href="#Pyrgoma_dentatum"><i>P. dentatum</i></a> we have an occludent ledge exactly as in the present species;
but in that species the adductor plate is less developed than in <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P.
monticulariæ</i></a>; on the other hand, in <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>P. crenatum</i></a>, the adductor plate is
more developed than in <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a>. If in <a href="#Pyrgoma_crenatum"><i>P. crenatum</i></a> we were
to remove the spur from the tergum (and it is much less developed in
<a href="#Pyrgoma_dentatum"><i>P. dentatum</i></a>; and in <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>P. milleporæ</i></a> it is entirely absent) this valve
would be almost identical with that of <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>P. monticulariæ</i></a>. Under these
circumstances I consider it impossible to separate the present species
as a distinct genus.</p>

<p class="p2"><a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a> is closely allied to <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>; and had not this
genus already been adopted by several authors, I should not,
I think, myself have formed it; though, no doubt, it harmonises
well with some of the other genera of the family,
which are perhaps all too intimately related. <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a> differs
from <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a> only in the shell being separated by sutures,
into four compartments, with well developed radii: in other
respects, such as in general habit, in the cup-formed imbedded
basis (not permeated by pores), in the opercular
valves, in the characters derived from the mouth and
cirri, there are no generic differences. This affinity is
more particularly evident when <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a> is compared with
the first few species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>: indeed, for a short time,
I was inclined to consider <i>var.</i> 10 of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a> as identical
with <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>Pyrgoma conjugatum</i></a>. With respect to the species of
<a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a>, I confess I have been much perplexed in determining
whether there be only one, or half a dozen. The
latter conclusion would almost certainly be arrived at if
only a few specimens were examined; and it might naturally
be thought that some of the species were extremely well
marked; the difficulty of drawing any line between varieties
and species, begins only when some hundreds of specimens,
from various parts of the world, are disarticulated,
cleaned, and carefully examined. <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a>, in this respect,
offers a striking contrast with <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, in which nearly all
the species are strongly characterised. The shell differs very
little in the several varieties or species of <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a>; and the
most marked difference, namely, whether the walls are
permeated by irregular pores or not, seems certainly quite<a name="Page_376" id="Page_376" href="#Page_376"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 376]</span></a>
variable. It is in the opercular valves, which in other genera
offer by far the most reliable character, that we encounter
the chief cause of perplexity; for the characters thus derived,
though at first appearing very distinct, blend into
each other, and are not accompanied by any well marked
differences in the shell. Only a few of my specimens have
any habitat; but the geographical range, as far as it does
go, throws no light on the question which forms to regard
as species and which as varieties. As is generally the
case with cirripedes, the variations are local, so that the
greater number of specimens imbedded in the same coral
resemble each other. Under these <span class="correction" title="In the original book: circustances">circumstances</span> I have
thought it best, after repeated examinations of a very large
suite of specimens, to describe separately each variety, without
attaching any name to it; but I will first make a few general
remarks on the structure of the shell. If I do not thus
throw much light on the subject, I shall at least not burden
it with error. I believe that the species will be definitely
made out only by persons resident in the coral-bearing
zones. I have given copious illustrations of the opercular
valves; for, if my view be correct, this genus offers a curious
and striking case of variation; if, on the other hand, I am
wrong, the drawings, I hope, will aid others in coming to
a more correct conclusion.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shell is oval, generally flat, sometimes
conical, with narrow and approximate ridges radiating from the orifice<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377" href="#Page_377"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 377]</span></a>
(fig. <a href="#p13f06a">6 <i>a</i></a>). The ridges, however, are sometimes distant from each other,
and considerably prominent, projecting round the basal border. The
orifice is either neatly diamond-shaped or oval. The four compartments
are quite distinct; the radii are generally white, of considerable width,
and with their summits not oblique. The colour is either white, or pale
pinkish-purple; but in <i>var.</i> 11, bright pink. Even in the white
specimens, when well preserved, the sheath is generally, but not
always, either pale or dark purple. The largest specimen which I
have seen, from the West Indies, was above half an inch in diameter;
but from .3 to .4 of an inch is the more usual full size. I believe that
the size, as well as the great variability of the present species, is partly
determined by the rate of growth of the various zoophytes in which the
specimens are imbedded, for the shell has to keep on nearly a level
with the surface of the coral.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell and Basis.</i>—The walls are internally ribbed; the
ribs being usually prominent, sometimes to such a degree as to deserve
to be called plates. The outer lamina is of variable thickness, and the
prominence of the internal ribs appears in considerable part to depend
on the extent to which the outer lamina has been thickened from within.
In many specimens, instead of the interspaces between these internal
ribs or longitudinal septa being solidly filled up, separate and successive
laminæ have been deposited, by which the shell is rendered cancellated
or porose; but the pores are very irregular; and sometimes they form
two or three irregular rows one behind the other: this structure seems
eminently variable. The edges of the radii are formed by crenated,
and occasionally branched, septa. That part of the alæ, which is
added during the diametric growth of the shell, is very thin. The lower
edge of the sheath seems always to be free. The shelly layer, forming
the basis, which is deeply cup-formed, is thin, more or less finely furrowed
in radiating lines, and not permeated by pores.</p>

<p>The opercular valves will be best described under the following eleven
varieties.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (1), Pl. <a href="#Page_697">13</a>, fig. <a href="#p13f06a">6 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p13f06b">6 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p13f06c">6 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p13f06d">6 <i>d</i></a>.—<i>Hab.</i> Java, and probably
several other districts.—I will first describe a typical sub-variety, by
which I mean a sub-variety not presenting any extreme character. The
scutum is of a sub-triangular shape, with the basi-tergal corner much
rounded off (<a href="#p13f06d">6 <i>d</i></a>), and generally but not always hollowed out in a rather
remarkable manner. The adductor ridge is considerably prominent,
and extends high up, parallel to the articular ridge, which latter is
rounded and prominent, but to a variable degree. Near the rostral angle
there is sometimes a small tooth, or only a trace of one, depending
beneath the basal margin; this tooth we shall hereafter see much more
developed. The <i>Tergum</i> is about two thirds of the width of the scutum.
It is often slightly beaked, but this is more conspicuous in some of the
following varieties. The spur is about half the width of the valve, and
its basal end is truncated, and nearly parallel to the basal margin of the
valve, but the truncated form passes insensibly into a rounded outline.
The shell in this variety is generally thick and is not permeated by pores;
the orifice is diamond-shaped. But in another sub-variety the walls of
the shell are always, or nearly always, permeated by pores, and the<a name="Page_378" id="Page_378" href="#Page_378"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 378]</span></a>
tergum is very much narrower, with the spur sharper, so that at first I
concluded that these two sub-varieties were specifically distinct: we shall,
however, soon see in <i>var.</i> 2 and in <i>var.</i> 4, that no confidence whatever
can be placed in the exact breadth of the tergum, or in the porosity of
the walls; hence I have been driven to consider the two varieties just
mentioned as merely sub-varieties.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (2), fig. <a href="#p13f06e">6 <i>e</i></a>, <a href="#p13f06f">6 <i>f</i></a>, <a href="#p13f06g">6 <i>g</i></a>.—<i>Hab.</i> China; Red Sea.—The shell is
almost invariably permeated by pores, sometimes arranged in two or
three very irregular rows. In some specimens the scutum exactly resembles
that in <i>var.</i> 1, but with the tooth near the rostral angle often
rather larger: in other specimens the scutum is much more elongated
transversely (fig. <a href="#p13f06e">6 <i>e</i></a>), with the adductor ridge more medial, and the
basal margin not at all hollowed out at the basi-tergal corner of the
valve. The tergum, here, is the remarkable feature, being sometimes
excessively narrow, with a long sharp spur, which often, but not always,
terminates in a needle-like point. In other specimens, from the same
coral and certainly belonging to this same variety, the valve is not so
narrow (<a href="#p13f06g">6 <i>g</i></a>), and the spur not so pointed; consequently (as in several
analogous cases in other cirripedes) it is impossible to draw any line of
distinction between the specimens with the narrow and broad terga.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (3), fig. <a href="#p13f06h">6 <i>h</i></a> [<em>Creusia gregaria of G. B. Sowerby!</em>]—<i>Hab.</i> Unknown.—The
scutum presents here exactly the same considerable range
of variation as in <i>var.</i> 2. The tergum is broad, as in <i>var.</i> 1, but the
spur is rounded, and from not being placed so immediately close to the
basi-scutal angle of the valve, gives to it a rather different aspect. The
breadth of the spur varies; an extreme variety is given in fig. <a href="#p13f06h">6 <i>h</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (4), Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f06i">6 <i>i</i></a>, <a href="#p14f06k">6 <i>k</i></a>, <a href="#p14f06l">6 <i>l</i></a>.—<i>Hab.</i> Philippine Archipelago;
West Indies.—The <i>scutum</i> here presents the same sub-varieties as heretofore,
excepting that I have not seen any so much elongated transversely.
The shell is covered either with slight, closely approximate
ribs, as in the foregoing varieties, or with more distant and more
prominent ribs. In specimens taken out of the same branch of coral
the walls were either porose or solid. Sometimes the sheath is bright
purplish-pink. It is the <i>tergum</i>, again, which presents a remarkable
range of difference; for the longitudinal depression or furrow which
in the former varieties was quite open, here has its edges more or less
folded inwards, and is sometimes quite closed. This same variation
has been commonly observed in many species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, in which it
appears to be dependent on the age of the individual; but this does not
appear to be the case in the present genus. As a consequence of the
greater or less folding in of the two sides of the furrow, the spur is
rendered more or less narrow and pointed, and thus becomes removed
to a greater or less distance from the basi-scutal angle of the valve.
Further, as a consequence of this folding in, the internal surface of the
valve along the line of the external furrow, is raised into a longitudinal
ridge. The length of the spur varies considerably. In some very
young individuals, the basal margin descends lower on the scutal than
on the carinal side of the spur. In one set of specimens (fig. <a href="#p14f06l">6 <i>l</i></a>), a
plate extended from the carinal margin to near the central longitudinal
ridge just mentioned: a similar structure was described under <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>Pyrgoma
cancellatum</i></a>.</p>

<p><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379" href="#Page_379"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 379]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (5), Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f06m">6 <i>m</i></a>.—<i>Hab.</i> Unknown.—We have seen in
<i>vars.</i> 2 and 3 that the scutum varies considerably in shape: here it is
unusually narrow, with the adductor ridge almost touching the articular
ridge. There is no little tooth near the rostral angle, and the basi-scutal
corner is not hollowed out. The tergum also varies; in some individuals
it is truncated and like that figured of <i>var.</i> 1, but rather more
rounded; in other specimens (from the same branch of coral) the basal
margin so blends into the spur that the latter can hardly be discriminated
(fig. <a href="#p14f06m">6 <i>m</i></a>); in other respects the outline resembles pretty closely
that of one of the <i>sub-vars.</i> (fig. <a href="#p13f06f">6 <i>f</i></a>) of <i>var.</i> 2. The shell is not porose;
it is thick, with strong internal ribs, and resembles that of <i>var.</i> 1; but
it is of a pale purplish colour.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (6), <i>an. spec.</i>? fig. <a href="#p14f06n">6 <i>n</i></a>-<a href="#p14f06q">6 <i>q</i></a>.—<i>Hab.</i> Philippine Archipelago.—This
is a very remarkable variety; we have, imbedded in the same
coral, and with shells absolutely identical, specimens with the scutum
having three distinct but graduated forms. Firstly, a scutum transversely
elongated, in all external respects like some of the varieties
mentioned under <i>vars.</i> 2 and 3, with no rostral tooth, and not hollowed
out at the basi-tergal corner, but with the adductor ridge more prominent.
Secondly, a scutum of the same general shape, but with the
adductor ridge so much developed (fig. <a href="#p14f06n">6 <i>n</i></a>) as to descend slightly
beneath the basal margin, and to be seen when the valve is viewed
externally; there is a very slight tooth near the rostral angle (as in some
former sub-varieties), and which can be here rather more clearly seen
than hitherto, to be formed by the adductor ridge (closely united to
the external surface of the valve) extending thus far, and being here
produced a little downwards. Thirdly (<a href="#p14f06p">6 <i>p</i></a>), we have the adductor
ridge immensely developed, descending far below the basal margin of
the ordinary valve; and the basal margin at the basi-tergal corner is
angularly and deeply hollowed out. The appearance of the valve is
widely different from that in the first sub-variety, yet it is impossible to
separate the first and second sub-varieties, and it is almost equally certain
that the third sub-variety is only an exaggeration of the second. The
lower edge of the adductor ridge, in the third sub-variety, varies a little
in outline; it is deeply sinuous, and is produced at the rostral angle
into a point, of which we have heretofore seen only a feeble representation.
It would appear as if the great development of the adductor
plate had caused the exterior ordinary surface of the valve to shrink
or be less developed. There is a striking resemblance in the structure
here described with that in <a href="#Pyrgoma_cancellatum"><i>Pyrgoma cancellatum</i></a> and <a href="#Pyrgoma_conjugatum"><i>conjugatum</i></a>. The
terga belonging to the above scuta, also, vary; the spur being sometimes
square (<a href="#p14f06o">6 <i>o</i></a>), and sometimes bluntly pointed: when the spur runs in
the same exact line (<a href="#p14f06q">6 <i>q</i></a>) with the scutal margin of the valve, a peculiar
aspect is given to it, but this is by no means always the case. Both
opercular valves are often partially coloured pinkish-purple. The shell
is not porose; it is thin, with remarkably prominent internal plates;
it is apparently always of small size, which I attribute to this variety
inhabiting a hard thin plate-like coral. The sheath is bright pinkish-purple,
of which we have had instances in some of the other varieties;
and the shell itself is sometimes pinkish. Taking the scutum of the<a name="Page_380" id="Page_380" href="#Page_380"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 380]</span></a>
first sub-variety, together with the commonest accompanying variety
of tergum, I find it quite impossible to assign to it a specific character;
if, on the other hand, we consider the scutum of the third sub-variety
by itself, nothing can appear more distinct; but I must repeat, there
can be hardly a shadow of doubt that the three sub-varieties of scutum
here described, graduate into each other, and are specifically identical.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (7), fig. <a href="#p14f06r">6 <i>r</i></a>.—<i>Hab.</i> Probably Philippine Archipelago, associated
with <a href="#Balanus_quadrivittatus"><i>Balanus quadrivittatus</i></a>.—There can be hardly any question of this
being specifically identical with the last variety. It inhabits a different
coral. All the specimens were of small size. The walls are not so thin,
and the internal ribs not so prominent as in <i>var.</i> 6. The sheath is either
white or dull purple; I can, in short, point out no difference in the shell
from the typical <i>var.</i> 1. The scutum is not so much elongated
transversely as in <i>var.</i> 6, and the basi-tergal corner is more cut off,—in
which respect it resembles the common varieties. The adductor
ridge is largely developed, so as to be just visible when the valve is
viewed from the outside, in a degree between the first and second sub-varieties
of <i>var.</i> 6: but the most singular character is the larger development
of the tooth near the rostral angle, and this was the case in
the same degree in all the specimens which I examined. The tergum
resembles that rather unusual sub-variety of <i>var.</i> 6 (fig. <a href="#p14f06q">6 <i>q</i></a>), which
has the scutal margin and the one side of the spur forming a straight
line. It appears to me that it would be absurd to consider these slight
differences, in parts unquestionably subject to much variation, as specific,
when we are almost forced to admit that the much greater differences
in the three sub-varieties of <i>var.</i> 6, are not of specific value.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (8).—<i>Hab.</i> Unknown, Mus. Cuming.—I have seen only a
single specimen of this, and refer to it on account of <i>var.</i> 11. The shell
is rather steeply conical, with distant and prominent ribs; the radii are
narrow; the walls are not permeated by pores; the colour is pale
purple. Altogether its external appearance is very different from that
of the foregoing varieties; but the scuta are identical with those of
<i>var.</i> 1, excepting that the rostral tooth is rather larger, being nearly as
large as in the last, <i>var.</i> 7. The tergum precisely resembles that in
some specimens of <i>var.</i> 2. Hence this variety differs from the first two
varieties only in the shade of colour, the external shape, and the greater
prominence of the external radiating ribs of its shell. All these
characters are variable in the several foregoing varieties, and they have
been found, as yet, insufficient to discriminate species in any genus of
sessile Cirripedes.</p>

<h4><a name="Creusia_spinulosa_Varieties" id="Creusia_spinulosa_Varieties" /><i>Varieties With the Scuta and Terga Calcified Together.</i></h4>

<div class="detail">

<p><i>Var.</i> (9), Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f06s">6 <i>s</i></a> [<i>C. spinulosa</i>, of Leach (!)]—<i>Hab.</i> Unknown.—The
shell is undistinguishable by a single character from
many specimens of the first, third, and fourth varieties; it is not permeated
by pores. The scutum and tergum, with the exception of
the one striking difference of their being calcified together without
any trace of a suture, are identical with those of <i>var.</i> 3, as may be seen
by comparing the figures <a href="#p13f06h">6 <i>h</i></a> and <a href="#p14f06s">6 <i>s</i></a>. Hence to separate this form
specifically from <i>var.</i> 3, we should have to rely solely on the calcifi<a name="Page_381" id="Page_381" href="#Page_381"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 381]</span></a>cation
or union of the scuta and terga; but we have seen this is a point
which is variable in <a href="#Elminius_Kingii"><i>Elminius Kingii</i></a>, <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>Pyrgoma milleporæ</i></a>, and in some
species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The serial affinities, moreover, in <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, clearly
show that this is a character of no great importance. I must add that
in several specimens of several of the varieties, the scuta and terga
were so closely joined, that until careful examination, I was unable to
detect the suture separating them; such being the case it must be
quite unimportant for any functional purpose, whether or not the
valves are calcified together. I feel, consequently, hardly any doubt
that I have acted right in treating the present form as a mere variety.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (10) <i>an. spec.</i>? fig. <a href="#p14f06t">6 <i>t</i></a>.—<i>Hab.</i> Unknown.—This variety bears
nearly the same relation to <i>var.</i> 6, as the last variety did to <i>var.</i> 3. The
shell is rather stronger than in <i>var.</i> 6, with the internal ribs not so
prominent; and except in being tinted pale dull purple, it differs in
no respect from the shell of <i>var.</i> 1. If we imagine the scutum and tergum
in the third sub-variety of <i>var.</i> 6 (<a href="#p14f06p">6 <i>p</i></a>, <a href="#p14f06q">6 <i>q</i></a>), in which the adductor
ridge descends far beneath the true basal margin of the valve, to be calcified
together, without any suture, we shall produce almost the identical
valves of the present variety. The scutum, however, here is not quite
so much elongated transversely, and the occludent margin is spinose
and is furnished with large teeth; these two characters give the valve
a somewhat different aspect, and hence I am more doubtful than in the
foregoing case, whether this form may not be specifically distinct. I
must, however, state that in <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a>, I ascertained that the
teeth on the occludent margin of the scuta were even more variable
than here is supposed to be the case; and as for the shape of the
valve we have seen what wonderful variation there is in <i>var.</i> 6. The
tergum in this variety is about intermediate between the two common
forms, in the sub-varieties of <i>var.</i> 6. As for the calcification of the
two valves together, we have seen, under the last variety, how little
important a character it is.</p>

<p><i>Var.</i> (11) fig. <a href="#p14f06uu">6 <span class="smcap lowercase">U</span></a>, <a href="#p14f06u">6 <i>u</i></a> [<i>Creusia grandis</i>, of Chenu, Tab. 1, fig. 2,
but not fig. 2 <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>].—<i>Hab.</i> Singapore, associated with <a href="#Pyrgoma_monticulariae"><i>Pyrgoma
monticulariæ</i></a>.—This variety is very closely related to the last. The shell,
however, has a very peculiar aspect, which made me for some time
think it must be specifically distinct. It is of a much brighter pink
than in any of the foregoing varieties; the surface is marked with very
prominent, distant ribs, and the radii are narrow, in which latter points,
together with the tint (though here brighter), this variety cannot be
distinguished from <i>var.</i> 7. The shell, however, is permeated by several
rows of pores, in which respect it resembles the shell in <i>var.</i> 2, and
some specimens of <i>vars.</i> 3 and 4. In the opercular valves there is a
close general resemblance with those of the last <i>var.</i> 10; the tooth,
however, near the rostral angle, is not so prominent; and in the tergum,
the spur is more truncated, shorter and broader than in <i>var.</i> 10, and
closely resembles that in <i>var.</i> 1 and 2. But I cannot consider any of
the points here specified of much weight.</p>


<p>The foregoing descriptions show how singularly the affinities of the
several varieties interlock in the most complicated manner. Hereafter<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382" href="#Page_382"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 382]</span></a>
some one may, perhaps, succeed in grouping several of these forms as
species; but I am sure he ought not to attempt it without possessing
a very large suite of specimens, or without the great advantage of comparing
some two or three of the forms, fresh in their native site.</p>


<p><i>Species dubiæ.</i>—Under <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, I have stated that though Chenu,
in his 'Illust. Conch.,' has given beautiful external figures of the
shells, imbedded in the coral, yet from the want of details on the opercular
valves and on the structure of the shell, I cannot recognise his
species. So it, likewise, is with <a href="#Sub-Genus_Creusia">Creusia</a>. Chenu gives the following
new species; <i>C. radiata</i>, <i>multistriata</i>, <i>decorata</i>, and <i>striata</i>. The <i>C.
madreporarum</i>, I suspect to be the <a href="#Pyrgoma_milleporae"><i>Pyrgoma milleporæ</i></a> of this work,
as there stated. The <i>C. grandis</i> no doubt is the <a href="#Pyrgoma_grande"><i>P. grande</i></a> of this
work, the <i>Nobia grandis</i> of Sowerby. The name <i>Creusia Childreni</i> is
given by Dr. Gray, without description or figure, in the 'Annals of
Philosophy,' vol. 10, new series, 1825.</p>

<p class="p2">This is a distinct and well-defined genus. Several
authors have confounded it with <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, but this has
been owing to an entire misapprehension of the structure
of the shell in the two genera. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, the parietes
are very thin, and are so deeply folded as to appear like
rays or septa connecting the outside of the shell (the ex<a name="Page_383" id="Page_383" href="#Page_383"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 383]</span></a>panded
ends of the folds) and the internal surface of the shell,
but the open spaces between the folds are occupied by the
epidermis of the Whale, and are external to the cirripede.
In <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: parieties">parietes</span> are remarkably thick; hence
the plates or septa, connecting the outer and inner lamina,
are of unusual length; and the spaces between them,
though of course internal with regard to the cirripede and
occupied by the ovaria, have been compared to the spaces
external to and between the folded walls of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. There
is but little special affinity between these genera; and I
regret that they have come to be placed one after the other in
this work: but the elongated opercular valves,—the thick and
double opercular membrane,—the weak depressor muscles,—and
the peculiar manner in which the scutum is articulated
by the aid of a horny projection to the tergum, may
indicate some real but slight affinity to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>; the many
points of difference, however, in the structure of the shell
and of the opercular valves, and especially in the cementing
apparatus of the basal membrane, and in the branchiæ, all
prove that the genera are very distinct. The singular
structure of the rostrum, which, in fact, consists of three
compartments externally blended together, and which three
correspond in all essential respects to the rostrum and two
rostro-lateral compartments in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, offers a
very striking point of identity with that sub-family; but
neither in the mouth, cirri, or other part, can I detect any
other evidence of this relationship. Having so far discussed
the affinities of the genus, I may add, that the three species,
though decidedly distinct, are closely and nearly equally
related to each other.</p>

<p><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shell is generally depressed,
and broadly oval or almost circular; in <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a> and
<a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>caretta</i></a>, it has a massive appearance: the surface is generally
smooth, or, when disintegrated, finely striated: the
colour is white. The six compartments do not differ much
in size: the rostrum is rather larger than the carina, and
the lateral compartments, than the carino-lateral compartments.
It is remarkable that in <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>C. caretta</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f02">2</a>),
even in specimens which have not grown crowded together,
the compartments are almost invariably placed rather un<a name="Page_384" id="Page_384" href="#Page_384"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 384]</span></a>symmetrically,
the rostrum and carina not exactly facing each
other.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[121]</span></a> The shell, though so thick and massive, yields easily
along the lines of suture. The radii are moderately wide,
or narrow, or not at all developed, being represented by
mere sutures: in this latter case, in <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>C. caretta</i></a>, the orifice
of the shell is enlarged, in the same manner as we have
seen in some species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> and <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>, by the
gradual wearing away of the upper part of the shell. In
<a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>, the radii have a singular notched structure
(fig. <a href="#p14f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>), and the whole shell a star-like appearance. The
orifice is not filled up by the elongated opercular valves,—a
considerable extent of opercular membrane being visible
on the two sides. The largest specimen which I have seen,
namely, of <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>, was nearly two and a half inches
in its longer diameter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_121_121" id="Footnote_121_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121_121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> In Mr. Stutchbury's collection there is a specimen of <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a> in
which there are only five compartments, one of the lateral compartments having
been aborted; of this I have seen no other instance in any genus.</p></div>

<p><i>Structure of the Parietes.</i>—The parietes are of unequalled
thickness, especially in the first two species of the genus.
From the outer lamina (see Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f04">4</a>, and the section
in Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f01">1</a>), numerous vertical plates extend inwards,
alternately to a less or greater distance, some of them reaching
to the inner lamina: these answer to the longitudinal parietal
septa in other genera, and the elongated cavities
between them (which occur in <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a> and <a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>patula</i></a>)
answer to the parietal tubes or pores. The radiating
plates or septa have their sides finely channelled, and their
basal edges generally slightly sinuous and always finely
toothed. The interspaces between the plates in the uppermost
part of the shell are filled up solidly, and, in <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>C. caretta</i></a>,
even down to near the basis: in this latter species, the
plates are irregular and much broken up, so as in parts to
consist of little, separate, flattened points. In <a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>C. patula</i></a>,
the inner lamina of the parietes (<i>b</i>, in fig. <a href="#p14f04">4</a>. Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>) can be
best made out to be distinct from the sheath (<i>e c e</i> in fig. <a href="#p14f04">4</a>,
and <i>c′</i> in the section of <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>, fig. <a href="#p15f01">1</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>). The
sheath in this genus descends in a very remarkable manner
to the basal membrane, and has its basal edge toothed like
the basal edges of the radiating septa. The inner lamina<a name="Page_385" id="Page_385" href="#Page_385"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 385]</span></a>
itself does not descend to the basal membrane. In <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>,
the inner lamina is of great thickness; but in the
section, (fig. <a href="#p15f01">1</a>) owing to its having been taken high up, the
inner lamina, (<i>b</i>), is not distinct from the shelly matter deposited
between the septa. In <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>C. caretta</i></a>, the line of separation
between the inner and outer laminæ can in no part be distinguished,
owing to the interspaces between the septa
having been solidly filled up, close down to the basis.</p>

<p><i>Sheath.</i>—The layer of shell surrounding the internal
cavity (<i>e c e</i>, fig. <a href="#p14f04">4</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>), and extending down to the basal
membrane, I have called the sheath, owing to its being
distinctly continuous with the innermost layer in the upper
part of the shell, to which the opercular membrane is attached:
this can be best seen by examining the alæ in the
separated compartments of <a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>C. patula</i></a>. The sheath is not
only remarkable from thus descending to the basal membrane,
but in <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a> and <a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>patula</i></a> from its lower edge
being perforated by arched channels (under <i>c</i>, in fig. <a href="#p14f04">4</a>),
allowing thick ribbons of corium to reach the interspaces
between the radiating septa. There is one central arch or
channel in the middle of the lower part of the sheath of each
compartment, and one on each line of suture, the sheath
being a little hollowed out on both sides of the sutures. As
the rostrum, as far as its internal structure is concerned,
consists of three compartments, we have altogether in the
shell eight compartments and eight sutures, and consequently
altogether sixteen arches through the lower part of
the sheath, allowing sixteen thick ribbons of corium to
penetrate the parietes, and thus likewise reach the radii.
There is, however, sometimes a little variation in the
number of these arched channels. The upper part of the
sheath is transversely marked by zones of growth, to the
lower one of which the opercular membrane is attached.
The line of attachment is not low down the sheath.</p>

<p><i>Radii and Alæ.</i>—The radii, when the compartments are
disarticulated, present a remarkable structure, from appearing
to consist of a distinct inner and outer portion. The
radius normally consists of an inner and outer lamina,
united by septa parallel to the basis; but here the inner
portion is formed by a central ridge (<i>a a</i>, fig. <a href="#p14f05">5</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>), send<a name="Page_386" id="Page_386" href="#Page_386"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 386]</span></a>ing
off on both sides little septa, often sub-branched; it is
of nearly uniform width; and there is no distinct inner lamina.
The outer portion (<i>b</i>), which often equals or exceeds in
thickness the inner portion, is, in fact, the normal outer
lamina, developed to an unparalleled degree. In most
Cirripedes the edge of the radius is received in a slight
furrow in the opposed compartment, the lid of which furrow
is narrow, and matches the outer lamina of the radius;
here the lid of the recipient furrow is very broad, and
resembles the outer lamina of the radius in all its characters.
In order to allow of growth between the <i>thick</i> opposed
edges of the outer lamina of the radius and the lid of the
recipient furrow, the two surfaces are finely dentated (look
in fig. <a href="#p14f05">5</a>, under the pits, marked <i>b</i>), almost like the crown
of a molar tooth; thus allowing films of corium to enter.
The structure here described is common, in a greater or less
degree, to all three species, but is best seen in <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>.
In this species, moreover, (fig. <a href="#p14f05">5</a>, <i>b</i>), the outer
lamina, instead of being smooth and of either equal or
gradually increasing thickness from top to bottom, is generally,
but not always, (fig. <a href="#p14f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>), deeply pitted or notched
in transverse lines, the outer lamina being thus rendered
alternately thicker and thinner, and so formed into
transverse ridges and valleys. Hence the lines of suture
become toothed, the points of the teeth facing each other,
and not interlocking. In the transverse section, fig. <a href="#p15f01">1</a>,
Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, of the same species, taken high up across the shell,
(<i>f</i>) is the pitted outer lamina, and (<i>e</i>) the inner portion of
the radius. Although the radii are thus specially added to
in thickness, they are not so thick as the very thick walls,
and hence the lines of suture form furrows more or less
deep. The <i>alæ</i> are of moderate thickness, and have their
sutural edges crenated by fine transverse septa.</p>

<p><i>Rostrum.</i>—I have already alluded to the peculiar compounded
structure of this compartment, unlike anything
we have as yet seen.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[122]</span></a> The thin outer lamina is quite
continuous, and shows no trace of the triple nature of the
compartment; as may be seen by comparing the drawing<a name="Page_387" id="Page_387" href="#Page_387"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 387]</span></a>
(Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>) of the shell of <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>, with the
transverse section (Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f01">1</a>) of the same species: in
this latter figure, <i>a</i> is the outer lamina, and <span class="smcap lowercase">B A B</span> the three
compartments of the rostrum. But when the outer lamina
is worn away, as is always the case with the upper part of
the walls in <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>C. caretta</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f02">2</a>), the two fissures
separating the three compartments of the compounded
rostrum, are plainly exhibited on the outside of the upper
part of the shell. On the internal surface, the sutures
separating the three compartments are always open, except
in the upper part of the sheath, above the attachment of the
opercular membrane, where they are partially obliterated
by a thin continuous layer of shell. That these three portions
of the rostrum are in their essential nature compartments,
is well shown in <a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>C. patula</i></a> and <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>testudinaria</i></a>, by the
sheath or inner lamina having loopholes or channels (such
as before described) in the middle of each, and on each line
of suture. From the number of these channels, seven
altogether, (the two between the compound rostrum and
lateral compartments being counted,) the sheath of the compound
rostrum is reduced to mere flattened pillars between
the several channels. By slight violence, the rostrum breaks
into the three portions; and the sutures between them are
found to be marked on both sides by sinuous, slight,
calcareous ridges, those on opposite sides locking into each;
these represent the septa on the edges of the radii and alæ
and their recipient furrows, in the ordinary compartments.
The outline of the middle compartment of the three (best
seen in section Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f01">1</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>), much resembles that of
the carina; in fact, if we suppose the growth of the two alæ
of the carina to have been arrested, no essential difference can
be pointed out: in this rudimentary compartment, therefore,
we have a rostrum, characterised as in the sub-family of the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>. In the two little rostro-lateral compartments,
moreover, (<span class="smcap lowercase">B B</span>), a slight swelling on the side opposite to
the large existing radius, shows that if the development of
these compartments had not been prevented, each, probably,
would have had, exactly as in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, a radius on
both sides. In the introduction to the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, I have
argued, from the structure here described and from some<a name="Page_388" id="Page_388" href="#Page_388"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 388]</span></a>
other facts, that in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> the rostrum is composed
of the three anterior compartments, which we see in the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, indissolubly united together; hence in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>
the middle one of the three partially-blended compartments
is properly the rostrum, and those on the sides
the rostro-lateral compartments.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_122_122" id="Footnote_122_122"></a><a href="#FNanchor_122_122"><span class="label">[122]</span></a> My attention was first called to this peculiar structure of the rostrum by
Mr. Stutchbury.</p></div>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—The basal membrane extends under the thick
walls to the outside. I was not able to make out the
whole cementing apparatus. The main trunk is remarkable
from its small diameter, (<i>f f</i> in fig. <a href="#p28f02">2</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>), and from
the distance at which the cement-glands stand apart. Each
gland gives rise to a pair of cement-ducts, which tend to run
in parallel groups; these ducts repeatedly bifurcate, occasionally
inosculate, and decrease in diameter; they debouch
and allow the cement to escape at numerous points, placed
at irregular distances, on the edges of each new slip of the
basal membrane.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves.</i>—These are elongated; they do not
fill the orifice of the shell; they are attached by a strong
opercular membrane a little way down the sheath. The
opercular membrane is generally double, for the last-formed
membrane is not immediately moulted as soon as a new one
is formed, as generally happens in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. Externally, the
valves are marked by rather rugged, broad zones of growth.
The <i>Scuta</i> are elongated in the line of the orifice of the
sack; the occludent margin (Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>) is much inflected,
and generally sinuous; along this inflected portion
a distinct square-edged ridge runs, which widens from the
apex downwards. The depression for the adductor muscle
is very deep: there are no pits or crests for the other muscles.
When the scutum is thoroughly cleaned and all the membrane
removed by caustic potash, the tergal margin is marked
by a slight articular ridge and furrow. This articular ridge
is very remarkable from supporting a prominent, flattened
crest (fig. <a href="#p14f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), composed of hard, yellow, horny membrane,
which overlaps the inner surface of the tergum, and exactly
corresponds, in shape and purpose, with the calcareous articular
ridge, when best developed in other genera. Beneath
the basal and generally slightly sinuous exterior margin of
the valve, that is, the margin to which the opercular mem<a name="Page_389" id="Page_389" href="#Page_389"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 389]</span></a>brane
is attached, a slight ledge depends (fig. <a href="#p14f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>), which
narrows off towards the rostral end of the valve. I should
have thought that this had been a depending adductor
ridge, as in several species of <a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>, had there not been
a nearly similar ledge beneath the middle part of the basal
margin of the tergum. The <i>Tergum</i> is mitre-formed, with
the summit more or less truncated, and with the carinal
margin generally more sloping than the scutal margin: near
the carinal margin there is a slight furrow (fig. <a href="#p14f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>), sometimes
difficult to be distinguished, with the lines of growth
curving down to it on each side, and consequently with a
very slight, but variable, corresponding projection on the
basal margin. This furrow and slight projection, there can
be hardly any doubt, represent the spur, though here placed
close to the carinal instead of to the scutal margin, as in
other genera. The tergum has a small articular ridge,
against which the overlapping horny articular ridge of the
scutum abuts. There are no crests for the tergal depressor
muscles. Altogether the scuta and terga are very peculiar.
A portion dissolved in acid exhibits no tubuli. On the
opercular membrane there are no hairs. The rostral depressor
muscles of the scuta are singularly feeble, each consisting of
only one or two, or sometimes three or four, very thin
ribbon-like fasciæ; the lateral depressores of the scutum are
twice as strong as the rostral depressores; and the tergal
depressores a little stronger than the lateral depressores.
All these muscles are plainly marked with transverse striæ.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The labrum is not in the least bullate, which
character, as well as some others that follow, I specify on
account of the apparent affinity of <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a> to the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>,
as indicated by its rostrum. The crest of the labrum
is notched, and on each side of the notch there is a long
row of teeth, which, however, are sometimes worn away.
The mandibles have five main teeth; all excepting the first
being laterally double. The maxillæ are not notched. The
outer maxillæ are bilobed on their inner sides.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The four posterior pairs, in proportion to the
size of the animal, are much elongated, and are remarkable
from the number of their short segments. The rami of the
first cirrus are a little unequal in length. The second<a name="Page_390" id="Page_390" href="#Page_390"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 390]</span></a>
cirrus is moderately short, with its segments rather broad
and protuberant, and thickly clothed with spines. The
third cirrus is of unusual length, being but little shorter
than the fourth pair; its segments, however, are broad,
and are thickly clothed with spines, as are the two segments
of its pedicel: hence there is no real approach to that important
character of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, namely, the similarity
of the third with the three posterior pairs of cirri. The
numerous segments of the fourth, fifth, and sixth pairs of
cirri each support only two pairs of main spines; between
each of these pairs there is a little tuft of fine intermediate
spines; the upper of the two tufts on each segment is the
longest. In a specimen of <a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>C. patula</i></a>, in which there were
fifteen segments in one ramus of the second cirrus, there
were fifty segments in either ramus of the sixth cirrus. At
the exterior bases of the pedicels of some of the anterior
cirri, there are large tufts of finely plumose, delicate hairs.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ.</i>—These are of large size: they consist of a
single fold, much plicated and sub-plicated.</p>

<p><i>Ovaria.</i>—The ovarian tubes run into the parietes, and
fill up the interspaces between the radiating septa.</p>

<p><i>Range, &amp;c.</i>—The three species seem to range together,
over the tropical and warmer temperate seas of the whole
world. <a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>C. patula</i></a> and <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>testudinaria</i></a> are found in the Mediterranean,
and the former at Charleston, in the United States;
I have not heard of specimens from any point further
north. <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a> and <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>caretta</i></a> live attached to turtles;
whilst <a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>C. patula</i></a> always adheres to crustacea, to large and
smooth gasteropod mollusca, and, I believe, sometimes to
ships' bottoms. I have not heard of the discovery of any
fossil species.</p>

<p><i>Attachment.</i>—<a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>Chelonobia patula</i></a> leaves no impression on
the crabs and shells to which it is attached. I have seen
only a few specimens of <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a> attached, and the
carapaces of the turtle were not at all, or scarcely at all, indented
by them. The case is very different with <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>C. caretta</i></a>,
in which the shell, even of young specimens, is always, as far
as I have seen, imbedded to some depth, and occasionally
to a very great depth in the tortoise-shell. From the extreme
hardness of the tortoise-shell, when dry, the imbedment<a name="Page_391" id="Page_391" href="#Page_391"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 391]</span></a>
appears more wonderful even than it really is. The younger
shells have the appearance of having grown from within the
carapace, and then of having burst through it, almost like
little volcanos. I have seen only one very young shell (1/10th
of an inch in external diameter) attached, and here there was
nothing to countenance an idea which at one time occurred
to me, namely, that the larva perhaps fixed itself in some
little crack or cavity in the carapace, and there underwent
its metamorphosis. I believe that the imbedment is effected
simply by the sharp, growing, basal edges of the walls of
the shell indenting the surface, and finally rupturing the
outer laminæ of the tortoise-shell, through that same force
by which the tender radicle of a plant penetrates very
hard ground. As soon as the surface was once ruptured,
the shell of the <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, growing outwards and
downwards, would easily, like a wedge, turn up the laminæ
of the tortoise-shell; and their ragged ends would surround
the <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, as is seen actually to be the case. In the
genus <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and its allies, which are attached to Cetaceans,
we shall presently see, that the epidermis immediately
under the downward growing shell, and apparently
in consequence of the pressure thus exerted, is thinner than
in the surrounding parts. In two specimens of <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>Chelonobia
caretta</i></a>, imbedded much more deeply than usual—in one of
which half the basal edge of the shell had fairly cut
through the carapace, and in the other was on the point of
effecting this—the tortoise-shell manifestly thinned out towards
the line of yielding; now this, I suppose, must be
attributed either to absorption, or to the living tortoise-shell
being actually stretched till rendered transparent and
ready to burst or until bursted. On the latter view of the
tortoise-shell having been stretched, we must further suppose
that the pressure has prevented fresh layers of tortoise-shell
being deposited under the old and yielding laminæ.
In one of the above two specimens, the walls of the <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>
were deeply folded, nevertheless the laminæ of the
tortoise-shell followed every curvature, showing that, though
now so rigid, during the slow imbedment of the Cirripede it
must have been sufficiently pliant. A shell attached, as these
two specimens were, could never be removed, and, whether<a name="Page_392" id="Page_392" href="#Page_392"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 392]</span></a>
dead or alive, would remain for ever imbedded in the tortoise-shell.
Dr. R. Ball, of Dublin, informs me, that he has seen
specimens in which the shell of the cirripede not only had penetrated
the carapace, but likewise the underlying bone, and
had even entered some way into the body of the turtle: it is
well known that the tusk of a boar or the horn of a ruminant,
when curving in abnormally, will sometimes penetrate
deeply into the bones of the face or head; and this, I believe,
is effected, not by the fracture of the bone, but by the
absorption of the point pressed on: I conceive a similar
process must have taken place in the curious specimens
examined by Dr. Ball.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell strong, globulo-conical, depressed; outline
broadly oval; surface smooth, generally well preserved, but when
disintegrated, upper part finely striated; colour dead white; orifice
oval elongated, rather exceeding in length one third of the longer basal
diameter of the shell. The radii are rather narrow, and deeply
depressed; they have their summits square: their outer lamina, as
explained under the genus, on both sides of each suture is in most
specimens divided into teeth, the points of which face and touch each
other. These teeth or notches give quite a peculiar appearance to the
shell, and alone suffice to discriminate this species; they are sometimes
blunt and partially obliterated, but it is rare to find a specimen in
which some few teeth do not occur in some one of the six radii. I
have, however, seen two or three specimens with all six radii perfectly
smooth; in one of these the general shape of the shell, without the aid
of any internal characters, almost sufficed to show that it belonged to
the present species; but in another specimen, which had unusually
narrow radii, and the whole surface of which had undergone considerable
disintegration, and was consequently striated, could only be distinguished
from <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>C. caretta</i></a> by internal characters. I have seen several
specimens having very irregularly shaped compartments, but generally
the appearance of the whole shell is highly symmetrical, like a star;
and the genus was appropriately named by old Klein, <i>Astrolepas</i>. In
some specimens, in Mr. Cuming's collection, from the Low Archipelago,
in the Pacific, taken off the toe-nail of a turtle, the shape was
almost cylindrical; the shell almost resembling that of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>Coronula diadema</i></a>.
The largest specimen which I have seen was 2.3 of an inch in
basal diameter, but only .55 in height.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell and Radii.</i>—After the full generic description,
the only point to which I need allude is, that the radiating, parietal
septa, as well as the descending sheath, are much thicker than in <a href="#Chelonobia_patula"><i>C.
patula</i></a>, and that their basal edges can be plainly seen by the naked eye
to be dentated with numerous points. The thickness of these plates
and of the sheath varies considerably. In <a href="#Chelonobia_caretta"><i>C. caretta</i></a>, I may add, the
plates are broken up into many separate points, and in this species
the descending sheath is not generally perforated, excepting at the
sutures, by loop-holes for the entrance of ribbons of corium. The<a name="Page_394" id="Page_394" href="#Page_394"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 394]</span></a>
sheath and inner lamina of the parietes in <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>, taken together,
fully equal one third of the entire thickness of the walls.
Flattened cavities or tubes run up between the parietal septa for about
two thirds of the height of the inside of the shell. With respect to
the radii, I have only to add, that the thickness of the inner portion
relatively to the generally notched outer lamina, varies considerably.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves</i> (fig. <a href="#p14f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>-<a href="#p14f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>).—These closely resemble each other
in all three species, and have been almost sufficiently described under
the genus. The scutum has its occludent margin always sinuous, but
to a variable degree. In one specimen there was a deep little pit at the
rostral end for the rostral depressor muscle. The terga vary considerably
in shape, according as the basi-carinal corner is more or less
truncated. The external furrow, marking the position of the rudimentary
spur, varies much in distinctness, chiefly depending upon its
nearness to the carinal margin of the valve.</p>

<p><i>Mouth and Cirri.</i>—The labrum sometimes has its teeth worn away.
The second pair of cirri, relatively to the others, is shorter and thicker
than in the two following species.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell extremely strong, massive, heavy,
broadly oval, globulo-convex, though sometimes depressed; dirty
white: surface in the upper part always worn and disintegrated,
hence finely striated; in the lower part a little rugged, slightly folded,
and occasionally, in deeply imbedded specimens, much folded or
ribbed. Orifice oval, not at all angular, rather exceeding in length
one third of the basal diameter of the shell. Radii either not at all
developed, or very narrow; but even in the former case the six lines of
suture are plain; and in the latter case the radii lie at some depth beneath
the surface of the shell. It is remarkable that the compartments
are hardly ever arranged symmetrically, the rostrum and carina not<a name="Page_395" id="Page_395" href="#Page_395"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 395]</span></a>
facing each other exactly; and this holds good in specimens attached
separately, without any apparent cause for this want of symmetry.
The largest specimen which I have seen was 2.1 in basal diameter;
and this, which was a steeply conical individual, was 1.1 in height;
and therefore nearly twice as high as an ordinary large specimen of
<a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell and Radii.</i>—The descending sheath and radiating
septa are of very variable thickness, and have their basal edges finely
dentated. The septa are not continuous, from the circumference to the
sheath, in unbroken plates, but are irregularly divided into separate,
often short portions, and even occasionally into mere points. The
sheath differs from that of the other two species in having loopholes
for the entrance of ribbons of corium only on the eight lines of suture,
and not (with rare exceptions) in the middle of each compartment:
this is evidently due to fewer filaments of corium being here sufficient
to supply the less deep interspaces between the radiating septa; for in
this species there are no flattened cavities or tubes running far up the
shell. The inner lamina of the walls cannot be here distinguished, for
a solid, flat, calcareous surface extends from the circumference, between
the radiating septa, to the sheath. The sheath, had it not been from
the light thrown on this part by the other species, would have certainly
been mistaken for the inner lamina of the walls. The absence of the
flattened cavities or tubes extending up the parietes, seems to be the
least varying character; and serves to distinguish this species from
those worn and massive specimens of <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>, which have
narrow and not-notched radii.</p>

<p>In specimens in which the radii are not developed, no vestige of the
outer lamina can be detected, the lateral faces of the adjoining
compartments being closely pressed together; but in specimens in
which the radii have been developed and have grown, the outer lamina
of course is present, and is extremely thick, with the growing edge
having a branched and mammilated surface, as in <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>, but
with the external surface not pitted or notched as in that species.
The inner portion of the radius, whether or not developed, has nearly
the same appearance, consisting of rather thick transverse septa,
branching from a central ridge, which is sometimes obscure.</p>

<p>The <i>Alæ</i> are remarkably little prominent, as least in those specimens
in which the radii are not developed, so that Spengler seems to have
thought that the structure of the shell was essentially different from that
of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, which certainly is by no means the case. The edges of the
alæ are very thick, nearly as thick as the inner portion of the radius.</p>

<p>The <i>Opercular Valves</i> hardly present any essential difference, compared
with those of the other species; but the occludent margin of
the scutum is apt to be more sinuous, and its rostral end blunter and
squarer. The carinal end of the tergum is also squarer than in any
common variety of <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>; the external furrow or spur, near
the carinal margin, is very indistinct, and even sometimes is quite
absent.</p>

<p>Neither the mouth nor cirri present any deviations from the generic
character.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell white, very smooth, of little specific
gravity, steeply conical, but not high; orifice broadly oval, polygonal,
very large, namely, generally exceeding half the basal diameter of the
shell. The summits of the compartments are usually perfectly preserved,
pointed, and often a little recurved. The radii are rather
broad, very smooth, with their summits slightly oblique and arched:
they are seated only a little below the general level of the parietes. I
have seen one specimen rather more than one and a half inch in basal
diameter, but this is an unusual size; this species not growing to so
large a size as the two foregoing forms.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell and Radii.</i>—The walls are here thinner than in
the two foregoing species; and the basal surface of a compartment
rarely equals half the basal diameter of the internal cavity of the shell,
measured transversely to its longer axis. The radiating septa are also
much thinner, generally sinuous, and so finely dentated along their
basal edges, that the teeth can be clearly perceived only by the aid of
a lens. The interspaces between the septa run up to nearly the summits
of the compartments, and hence the lightness of the whole shell.
The inner lamina of the parietes is here not so thick (fig. <a href="#p14f04">4</a>), and is
more distinct from the descending sheath than in the foregoing species.
The sheath is thin, like the radiating septa; the medial loophole in
each compartment, for the entrance of a filament of corium, is much
wider than in <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>, for it is generally as wide as the bordering
plate on either hand; and in not a few specimens, the medial loophole
is so wide as hardly any longer to deserve being so called, for the
descending sheath is reduced to mere flattened pillars or legs on the
sides of the sutures. Although the parietes are here not nearly so thick
as in the two foregoing species, yet as the radii stand but little beneath<a name="Page_397" id="Page_397" href="#Page_397"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 397]</span></a>
the level of the parietes, the outer lamina of the radius has a considerable
thickness, and is sometimes separated from the inner portion of the
radius by an interval, in the same manner as in <a href="#Chelonobia_testudinaria"><i>C. testudinaria</i></a>;
and the growing edges of the outer lamina exhibit traces of the same
mamillated structure as figured in that species.</p>

<p>The <i>Opercular Valves</i> are apt to be rather narrower and more elongated
than in the foregoing species, with the occludent margin of the
scutum generally, but not always, only slightly sinuous: externally the
scutum is sometimes feebly striated longitudinally. In the tergum
(Pl. <a href="#Page_698">14</a>, fig. <a href="#p14f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>) the longitudinal furrow is generally plainer, from
being more distant from the carinal margin, and the rudimentary spur
itself is more prominent.</p>

<p>The mandibles usually have five narrow teeth; but I have seen one
specimen having only four teeth, and with the inferior angle truncated.
The cirri present no particular character.</p>

<p class="p2">This genus and the three following, namely, <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>,
<a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, have very considerable claims
to be separated as a sub-family, as has been proposed by
Drs. Leach and Gray. Although in structure and habits
they are certainly closely related together; yet only few
characters can be predicated of all four in common,—some
characters failing in one genus and some in another. All
four, however, differ from the foregoing genera in the opercular
valves not being articulated together, being simply
united by tough horny membrane; but <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a> makes
some approach in this respect. All four have the branchiæ
composed of a double fold; but this can hardly be considered
a character of much weight, as may be inferred from
the remarks made on this subject at p. <a href="#Page_153">153</a> of the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>,
where the differences of these four genera from the
other genera of the family are discussed at some length.
Altogether I have been led to conclude, though with much
hesitation, that these genera had better not be separated as
the sub-family of Coronulinæ.</p>

<p>Our present genus, <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, is closely related to <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>,
and likewise to <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, though this latter
genus is so very different in external aspect that it might
easily be mistaken for a pedunculated Cirripede. Lamarck
and some other authors have placed the species of <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>
under <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, but this has arisen, as explained
under that genus, from a misapprehension of their structure;
the folded very thin walls in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> having been compared
with the radiating septa of the very thick walls in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>.
I may further add, that <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> has been divided
into two genera by Ranzani, on palpably insufficient
grounds.</p>

<p><i>General Appearance.</i>—The three recent species of this
genus have a very handsome and striking appearance. The
shell is highly symmetrical, owing to the six compartments
being of the same size and having exactly the same outline.
The general shape is either depressed or, as expressed by
the name, like a crown. The walls are longitudinally and
slightly ribbed, owing, as we shall presently see, to their
wonderfully folded structure; and the surface is marked by
very fine longitudinal striæ, crossed by finely beaded lines<a name="Page_399" id="Page_399" href="#Page_399"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 399]</span></a>
of growth. Hence the walls offer a strong contrast in appearance
with the six, smooth radii, of equal breadth. The
symmetrically hexagonal, or rounded-hexagonal orifice of
the shell is closed by a thick, nearly horizontal membrane,
supporting, towards the rostral end, the small opercular
valves, with a slit, having protuberant lips, in the middle,
for the protrusion of the cirri. The opercular membrane is
attached all round, but a short distance beneath the summit
of the shell. In regard to size, I have seen a specimen
of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> two inches in height and two and a half in
diameter.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Shell.</i>—The structure at first appears
singularly complicated, and quite unlike that of any other
Cirripede; but the whole results simply from the folding
of the very thin walls, which in all essential respects are
constructed like those in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. In a young specimen
of <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, having the orifice of the shell 2/10ths of an
inch in diameter, I found the upper part of each compartment
only slightly sinuous, not more so than is common in
many varieties of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, but more symmetrical, for
each compartment had three slight furrows, making, for
the whole shell, eighteen furrows. The ensuing changes
during the growth of the shell will be best understood by
looking at the diagrams <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, in fig. <a href="#p15f10">10</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, which are
supposed to represent the basal margins of the walls of a
single compartment: (<i>a</i>) shows the simply sinuous wall of
the young shell. As the shell grows, the furrows rapidly
grow deeper and deeper (<i>b</i>), and wider and wider; at the
same time, the folds or ridges between the furrows gradually
become drawn out at their ends into transverse loops (<i>c</i>),
the extremities of which ultimately become closely pressed
together—the furrows being thus converted into cavities,
extending from the top to the base of the compartments.
This structure in the mature shell will be best understood
by looking at the transverse or horizontal section (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>,
fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>) of the rostral end of the shell of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, in which
species the folding of the walls is simpler than in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>
or <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>C. reginæ</i></a>: the walls (<i>e</i>) are represented by a
double line connected by little cross lines,—(<i>h</i>) being one
of the transverse loops at the outer end of one of the folds,<a name="Page_400" id="Page_400" href="#Page_400"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 400]</span></a>
and (<i>f′</i>) one of the cavities between the folded walls, open
at the bottom of the shell, and occupied by the epidermis
of the Whale. The walls of the compartments, as here represented,
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> being the rostrum, <span class="smcap lowercase">C C</span> the lateral compartments,
<span class="smcap lowercase">D D</span> the alæ of the carino-lateral compartments,) are separated
from each other by the broad radii; but if the section
had been taken low down near the basis, the end of the folded
wall of one compartment would have been separated from
that of the adjoining compartment only by the close suture:
this will be understood by a glance at the entire shell, given
in fig. <a href="#p15f03">3</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>. The rostrum of the same species, viewed
from the inside, is shown at fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>; here it may be
observed, that the basal margin (<i>e e′ e′′</i>) of the folded wall is
extremely oblique, the outer portion having extended downwards
much more than the inner portion: this obliquity is
more clearly shown in the lateral view (fig. <a href="#p16f02">2</a>) of a lateral
compartment, for this figure will equally well serve for a
lateral view of the rostrum (fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a>), if the ala (<i>a′</i>) be supposed
to be removed. The section of the rostrum in fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>, (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>),
will now be intelligible in relation to the view of the rostrum
given in fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a>, if it be borne in mind that the section
has been taken high up, near the letters <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c′′</i> in
fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a>.</p>

<p>As above stated, the folds or ridges in the young
shell become more and more transversely drawn out at
their ends into the transverse loops, till the latter join
and touch each other. In <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> the lines of junction
are simple, though very close; in the other species, the
ends of the transverse loops, where touching, are finely and
elegantly toothed, and thus locked together. These teeth
appear single when the shell is viewed either externally or
internally, but when the walls along the lines of junction
are forced apart, they are seen really to consist of transverse
rows of minute teeth. These teeth are less distinct,
forming only sinuous ridges in <a href="#Coronula_barbara"><i>C. barbara</i></a> (fig. <a href="#p15f06">6</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>); in
all cases the teeth are formed by the modification of the
very minute beads, which ornament the lines of growth
on the external surface of the shell. In the rostrum of
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, as seen internally (fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>), the serrated and
closely-fitting lines of junction (<i>f</i>) between the ends of the<a name="Page_401" id="Page_401" href="#Page_401"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 401]</span></a>
transverse loops of the folded walls are plainly shown. It
is the more or less rounded surfaces of the transverse loops
which give to the external surface of the parietes its longitudinally
ribbed structure: the ribs are plainest in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C.
diadema</i></a>, fig. <a href="#p15f03">3</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>. The shell, in fact, as seen externally,
consists of but an extremely small portion of the external
surface of the whole length of wall, being exclusively formed
of the transversely looped ends of the radiating folds,
together with the radii. Owing to the ends of the transverse
loops being so closely pressed together, the furrows
are practically converted (as already remarked) into cavities,
open only on the under side of the shell, and extending from
the oblique bases of the compartments up to their apices;
and these are invariably filled by the black epidermis of the
Whale. Owing to this circumstance, the skin of the Whale
has been mistaken by some authors for parts of the Cirripede!
In <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, in which the summit of the shell
is often a little disintegrated, the whale's skin is often there
exposed, forming three black spots at the top of each compartment.
It should always be remembered that these
flattened and deep cavities are furrows, which homologically
ought to be open in longitudinal lines along the external
surface of the shell, from the top to the bottom.</p>

<p>As the shell increases in diameter, each of the original
eighteen transverse loops, forming the exterior surface of
the shell, increases in breadth; and they would have had to
increase extremely, had not some of the transverse loops
become, during growth, divided into two or three new transverse
loops, in a manner strictly analogous with the first
formation of the eighteen folds in the young shell. In
Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f07">7</a>, <a href="#p15f08">8</a>, <a href="#p15f09">9</a>, we see how one of the circumferential
transverse loops, by the formation of a medial furrow, or
rather bay, becomes developed into two transverse loops;
and it is rather important to observe that three new loops
might equally well have been contemporaneously formed. By
the repeated formation of new circumferential loops and the
consequent formation of new folds, the wall of the shell, when
old, especially in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, becomes folded in a wonderfully
complicated manner, as may be seen in Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f05">5</a>, which
is an exact tracing of the extreme basal edge of the wall of<a name="Page_402" id="Page_402" href="#Page_402"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 402]</span></a>
a shell of <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>; to perceive the full amount of complication,
it is advisable to trace the wall of any one of the
compartments, from one suture (<i>s</i>) to another. In this
figure the sutures are purposely drawn a little open. It
may be seen that the new transverse loops, and consequently
the new folds of the walls, have been, in this species,
mostly formed in symmetrical order, on both sides of the
six sutures; this results from the transverse loops on the
sutures almost always giving rise contemporaneously to
three new transverse loops. In <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> the transverse
loops on the sutures usually divide into only two new loops,
one on the rostral side and one still remaining at the
suture; hence the folding of the walls in this species is
much less symmetrical. The number, however, of the
transverse loops and the exact pattern of the folding is
variable in all four species of the genus. I may further
add, to show the complication of the folds, that in a shell of
<a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, having a basal diameter of two inches, and
which had the walls as little folded as ever they are, yet
I found, by careful measurement, that the entire basal
edge of the wall, if stretched straight, would have extended
for a length of fifty-two inches! Therefore, if the wall had
not been folded, but had been simply circular, as in ordinary
cirripedes, the basal diameter of the specimen would have
been between sixteen and seventeen inches!</p>

<p>The central membranous basis is flat, but the bottom of
the folded walls of the shell is concave, which is caused by
the outer ends of the folded walls having grown at a greater
rate than the inner ends. The concavity is deep in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C.
diadema</i></a>; in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> it is much less so, and here the
inner hood-like ends of the folded walls are rather abruptly,
but in a variable degree, produced downwards, generally
even slightly beneath the level of the circumference of the
shell; this fact is of interest in relation to the peculiar,
depending, spur-like processes in the genus <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>. A
lateral view of a compartment in both these species, is given
in Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, figs. <a href="#p16f02">2</a> and <a href="#p16f03">3</a>; and by supposing in each case
a compartment to stand opposite, at a distance which may
be judged of from fig. <a href="#p16f05">5</a>, the vertical sectional outline
of the whole shell will be understood: in fig. <a href="#p16f03">3</a> of<a name="Page_403" id="Page_403" href="#Page_403"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 403]</span></a>
<a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, however, the inner hood-like ends of the
folded walls are not produced so much downwards as is
usual.</p>

<p>In the same manner, as the outside of the shell consists
of the transversely expanded ends of the folded walls,
pressed closely together, so the cavity in which the animal's
body is lodged, is formed by the inner and less closely joined
ends of the folds, lined by the thick sheath (<i>a</i>, fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a> and <a href="#p16f07">7</a>,
Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>), which latter extends down very near to the basal
membrane. The cavity for the body, is small compared to
the whole shell; in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> it is deeply cup-formed,
with a small, flat, membranous bottom or basis; in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>
it is wider and shallower, with a broader bottom, and
with the upper edges of the walls more inflected. In both
species, the thick membrane connecting the opercular valves
to the shell, is attached all round near the summit of the
sheath. The uppermost portion of the sheath is not marked
by concentric lines, as in most of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, owing to
the opercular membrane not being, as we shall presently
see, regularly moulted. A portion of a single wall, when
closely examined, is found to be formed of an outer and
inner lamina, united by longitudinal septa, and is thus permeated
by minute, square, longitudinal pores,—exactly as
in the normal structure of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. The walls are extremely
thin, and are striated longitudinally, owing to the slight projection,
on both the inner and outer surfaces, of the longitudinal
septa; they are thicker in the part forming the
external transverse loops, being here, in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, as much
as 15/1000ths of an inch in thickness; but when forming one
side of the spoke-like folds, the thickness is only 6/1000ths of an
inch. The inner lamina is thicker, contrary to what is
usual, than the outer lamina; the sharp tips of the longitudinal
septa project a little beyond either lamina, giving to
the basal edge of the wall a serrated outline. It is singular
that the thin outer lamina is first formed as a rim or ledge
on each side of the longitudinal septa; these ledges being
not closely united for some little space up the wall, as is
represented in the enlarged drawing of a bit of the basal
wall of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f06">6</a>. The open clefts thus
left are, of course, covered by the so-called epidermis, for<a name="Page_404" id="Page_404" href="#Page_404"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 404]</span></a>
otherwise the included threads of corium would have been
exposed. Each fresh period of growth, in the case of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C.
diadema</i></a> (fig. <a href="#p16f06">6</a>) and <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>reginæ</i></a>, and to a certain extent in
<a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, is marked by little knobs on the longitudinal,
slightly prominent, septa, and this prefigures an analogous
strongly marked structure in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>. A fine thread of
corium runs up each pore to the summit of the compartment;
for these pores are not, as in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, cut off by transverse
calcareous septa, or have their upper ends solidly filled up
with shelly matter. As, however, the summit of the shell in
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> is sometimes disintegrated, the threads of corium
within the pores would have been exposed, had not each thread
formed for itself, as I suppose, a transverse membranous septum
near the summit of the shell; at least this is the case
with the larger pores of the radii. The walls, where closely
pressed together in the spoke-like folds, are disunited at the
extreme base, but above this they are firmly calcified together.
A ribbon of corium runs along the basal edge of each spoke,
and sends threads of corium up the parietal pores on each side,
and its upper edge serves to deposit calcareous matter (homologous
with the layers of the sheath) and thus to unite the two
walls firmly together. In <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, the walls of the terminal
transverse loops are simply calcified together like the spoke-like
portions; but in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> the opposite sides of the
loops are united by septa (see the transverse section in
Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>), making from five to eleven longitudinal
tubes within each transverse loop; these tubes being larger
than the parietal pores. When a piece of the shell is dissolved
in acid, no tubuli can be discovered, which may be
accounted for by the thinness of the walls; nor are there
any spines on any of the external membranes. The number
of the pores, in the parietes of a moderately-sized specimen
of <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, I calculated was at 3400, each occupied by
a thread of corium springing from the eighteen branched
ribbons, diverging from the corium, surrounding the base
of the sack. To this number must be added between 300
and 400 larger threads of corium running up the tubes in
the transverse loops; and no less than about 2300 fringes and
threads occupying the pores in the six radii: thus we see that
the dermal system in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> is wonderfully complicated.</p>

<p><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405" href="#Page_405"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 405]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Radii.</i>—The radii are very wide in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>. In all
the species their summits are square or parallel to the basis.
Their internal structure is remarkable: as the walls in this
genus are extremely thin, so are the <i>proper</i> radii, for in fact
they consist in this and all cases, as we know, of one margin
of the wall modified by its lateral growth against the opposed
compartment. But as the radii in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> are not plicated,
like the walls, the shell would have been excessively weak
along the six lines of suture, had not the radii been
strengthened by numerous sinuous plates, springing from
the inner lamina of the proper radius, and running downwards,
attached to the folded wall of the compartment to
which the radius belongs, and with their free edges pressed
against the folded wall of the opposed compartment. These
plates give out short transverse denticuli, making altogether
a beautiful structure, as is best seen in Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f03">3</a>, but
also in fig. <a href="#p16f02">2</a> and <a href="#p16f04">4</a>, and <i>d</i> in fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a>. In the section, fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>,
the proper radius (<i>d</i>) is seen to be continuous with the wall
(<i>e</i>), and to be very thin, in fact forming but a small portion
of the compound radius: it is formed of an outer and inner
approximate lamina, separated by septa, which are nearly
horizontal, and which consequently cannot be shown in
the transverse section fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>. The outer lamina of the
radius is imperfect, or does not reach quite to the suture,
leaving the septa a little exposed (imperfectly shown in
Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f03">3</a>), exactly as is the case with the outer lamina of
the parietes, at the basal margin of the shell. In all common
<a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, a ribbon of corium runs up each of the six sutures,
and sends in fine threads between the septa of the radii,
but here a thread of corium runs up a minute, cylindrical
pore, situated on the line of junction between the radius and
the wall whence it arises; and from this longitudinal thread
the finer threads spring which pass between the horizontal
septa of the proper radius: this cylindrical pore is rather
large in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, but excessively small in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>
(see a black dot (<i>d′</i>) in <span class="correction" title="In the original book: section 7">section, fig. </span><a href="#p16f07"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: section 7">7</span></a>), and is solidly filled up in
the upper part of the shell. The plates (fig. <a href="#p16f03">3</a>) which
run down from the inner lamina of the proper radius, and
form the greater part of its thickness, are occupied by
fringes of corium, extending up from a ribbon of corium,<a name="Page_406" id="Page_406" href="#Page_406"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 406]</span></a>
running along each suture, like those which run along the
bases of the spoke-like folded walls. This difference in the
origin of the ribbons of corium, occupying the interspaces
between the plates and the pores in the proper radii, shows
the essential difference between the latter and the thick inner
portions of the compound radii. In <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> (fig. <a href="#p16f01">3</a>), the
compound radius extends from the outside of the shell to the
sheath and to near the basal edges of the folded walls: in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C.
diadema</i></a> (fig. <a href="#p16f02">2</a>), it does not extend so far inwards and downwards;
and in <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>C. reginæ</i></a> (fig. <a href="#p16f04">4</a>), even still less so. It ensues
from this circumstance that when, in these two latter species,
a transverse section is made across the middle of the shell, a
large chamber (<i>v</i>, fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>), occupied by the ovaria, is found on
each line of suture (<i>s s</i>), separating the radii (<i>d</i>) and alæ (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>Alæ</i> in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> (section, Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>, <i>a′</i>) and <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>C.
reginæ</i></a>, are of remarkable thickness, nearly equal to that of
the radii, and in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, of considerable thickness;
this is evidently to give strength to the shell, which is
weakest along the lines of suture, notwithstanding that the
radii have been specially thickened. The edge of each ala
presents a miniature resemblance of the edge of the radius,
namely, a central ridge sending off on both sides sinuous
plates, themselves denticulated. In <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, the ala
rests almost entirely on the inner surface of the compound
radius; but in the other two species, in which, as already
stated, the radii and alæ are separated by chambers, the ala
rests on a plate (<i>c′′</i> in fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a>, <a href="#p16f04">4</a>, and <a href="#p16f07">7</a>), which extends from
the top of the radius to the bottom of the sheath, narrowing
downwards (<i>c′′</i>, fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a>), and is a specially developed portion
of the sheath for the radius to rest on. In <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> and
<a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>reginæ</i></a>, the sides of the folded walls, at the ends of the
chambers (<i>v</i>, in section, fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>), are strengthened by the
deposition of layers of shell in connexion with the sheath.
The sheath extends close down to the basal membrane
in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, and does not project freely: in the other
two species it depends freely, but does not run quite so low
down. I have only further to remark, that the sutures,
though very strongly united, are not calcified together; for
they easily separate after the action of caustic potash.</p>

<p>The <i>Basis</i> (Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>-<a href="#p28f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>) is membranous and is<a name="Page_407" id="Page_407" href="#Page_407"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 407]</span></a>
formed of concentric slips: each slip has eighteen angles,
corresponding with the open ends (see Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f05">5</a>) of
the eighteen folds of wall. A ray of membrane runs under
each of these folds, being prolonged from the basal membrane;
but these rays can hardly properly be called parts
of the basal membrane, for they split at each period of
growth along the middle, and the two halves are drawn from
under the basal edges of the walls, and thus come to invest
their outer surfaces. The basal membrane, and the whole
cementing apparatus, which is much simpler than in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>,
has been fully described (p. <a href="#Page_135">135</a>) in the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves.</i>—In the sessile cirripedes hitherto examined,
the four opercular valves are inclined towards each
other, and nearly fill up the orifice of the shell, being united
to the walls by a more or less narrow circular border of membrane;
this membrane being attached rather low down to the
sheath. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> the opercular membrane is stretched like
the skin of a drum, almost horizontally across the top of the
shell; it is, however, generally attached to the sheath rather
lower down at the carinal than at the rostral end: hence the
animal's body, as remarked by Burmeister, is attached almost
horizontally; but this we shall see, under <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>
and <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, cannot be considered a character of much
importance. The valves are quite small compared with the
opercular membrane, and certainly are of little functional
importance. The scuta in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> and <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>diadema</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>,
fig. <a href="#p15f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>) are sub-triangular; but the under or growing surface
is elongated and arched. These valves stand almost
at the rostral end of the orifice, instead of on each side of it.
In <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> the terga are small, with the under surface
oval: in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> they are either quite aborted, or are represented
by a barely visible plate of shell, parallel and close to
the tergal margin of the scutum. The aperture leading into
the sack is formed by a nearly medial slit of considerable
length, furnished with irregularly protuberant, inwardly inclined
lips. These lips are formed by the development of
an inner fold or crest of membrane, which can be just
detected in most Cirripedes: the lips include a double fold
of corium, and are covered by a delicate tunic, continuous
with that lining the sack, and homologically continuous<a name="Page_408" id="Page_408" href="#Page_408"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 408]</span></a>
with the opercular membrane. The opercular membrane is
very thick, tough, and yellowish; it is, in parts, finely plicated
in lines radiating from the apices of the valves: these plicæ
consist of membrane in an altered condition, being harder,
more horny, and of a browner yellow; the plicæ are large at
the rostral end of the scuta, and projecting beyond these
valves, they afford attachment to the rostral depressor muscles.
Rims of similarly modified membrane (Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>)
connect the scuta and terga together. The rims and plicæ are
occasionally moulted together with the opercular membrane.
In almost all hitherto described <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, a new opercular
membrane is formed at each period of exuviation,
and as soon as formed, the old one is generally moulted,
together with the other membranes of the body: the
case is very different in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, in which it is evident,
from the lines of growth on the valves and sheath, that
a new membrane is formed only at rather long intervals,
and that it is formed in some degree extensible, so as
to allow of some growth in the shell. Two or even three of
these membranes are retained at the same time, one over
the other; and thus, by their joint thickness, they afford
protection to the included animal's body, and compensate
for the smallness of the opercular valves. In a large specimen
of <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, two inches in diameter, there had been
formed, since its existence as a very young shell, not more
than eight opercular membranes, whereas the other membranes
must have been moulted within this same period at
least thirty times. In a young specimen of this species,
having the orifice of the shell only two tenths of an inch in
diameter, I found the opercular membrane, as usual, double.
This membrane is not furnished with spines, nor is it penetrated
by tubuli as in most other genera. The tissue left
after the opercular valves have been dissolved in acid, presents
no tubuli, or any other recognisable character, and is
not divided (as is usual) into layers.</p>

<p><i>Muscles of the Sack.</i>—These muscles differ considerably
from those of other sessile cirripedes hitherto described.
There are the usual five (or properly six, the two tergal
muscles being here, as elsewhere, confluent) bundles of
fasciæ; but they hardly can be called bundles, they are so<a name="Page_409" id="Page_409" href="#Page_409"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 409]</span></a>
much spread out and thin. In <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, each rostral
muscle consists, in different specimens, of from three to five
principal fasciæ; these, at their upper ends, are attached to
the cartilaginous plicæ at the rostral extremities of the scuta;
at their lower ends, they do not reach (as in all the previous
genera) to the basal membrane, but after converging, they
diverge again into a little fan of fibres, which are firmly
attached to the corium low down on the sides of the sack.
The lateral depressores of the scuta consist each of about
three fasciæ, and they terminate downwards like the rostral
muscles. The tergal depressores are spread out into a thin
sheet; upwards they reach to the basal edges of the lips of
the sack-aperture, and downwards they curve a little towards
the rostral and opposite end of the shell, and extend nearly
to the basal membrane. These tergal muscles include two
fasciæ, larger than the others, which extend rather further,
both upwards and downwards, than the other fasciæ.
But the most novel character in these several muscles is that
in their lower portions they do not exhibit transverse striæ,
thus showing a tendency to become involuntary as in
pedunculated cirripedes. This circumstance, and their
feebleness, is easily accounted for by the thick unyielding
nature of the opercular membrane, and the feebly developed
character of the opercular valves. In <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, the
tergal muscles are much spread out, having, as in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>,
a larger fascia on each side; but the lateral depressores
of the scuta form a well defined nearly cylindrical bundle;
the rostral pair are extremely weak and spread out: I
could perceive only feeble transverse striæ on some of
these muscles, and on others there was not the least trace of
striæ. I may add that the adductor scutorum muscle is
well developed, as are the eight pairs of muscles which
unite the animal's body to the under surfaces of the scuta.
The action of the adductor scutorum serves to close the
sack-aperture, but towards the carinal end necessarily with
very small force; protection in this part can only be
afforded by the protuberant, valvular lips, and by the
dorsal surfaces of the inwardly curled cirri, with their tufts
of bristles.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The mouth (Pl. <a href="#Page_710">26</a>, figs. <a href="#p26f03">3</a>, <a href="#p26f04">4</a>) is much elongated<a name="Page_410" id="Page_410" href="#Page_410"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 410]</span></a>
transversely, and does not differ essentially from that of most
other <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>. The labrum is notched and not in the
least bullate, though in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> there is a slight prominence
outside close beneath the notch. The palpi are of
large size, with their bristly apices touching each other. The
mandibles are very strong, with from four to five main teeth,
which are remarkable by presenting only rudiments of
being laterally double; but between the second and third,
and between the third and fourth main teeth, there is a small
intermediate tooth,—these I have not met with in any sessile
cirripede hitherto described. The maxillæ are small, with
the two upper spines remarkably strong. The outer maxillæ
are on their inner faces bilobed. Between these organs
there is a minute projection, or mentum, flattened in the
longitudinal axis of the body; I have not noticed this in
any previous Cirripede.</p>

<p>The <i>Cirri</i> are short and extremely much flattened: the
three anterior pairs have their rami unequal in length by
two or three segments; the posterior edges of their pedicels
are fringed by tufts of extremely fine hairs. The pedicel
of the first cirrus is very broad; its rami are short, with
the segments very broad. The rami of the second and
third cirri are short, with the segments protuberant in
front and thickly clothed with spines; the terminal segments
have some short, thick, claw-like spines. The three
posterior pairs have protuberant segments, each supporting
three or four pairs of short, strong, main spines, with a
small intermediate tuft: the dorsal tuft is small.</p>

<p>The prosoma is of large size. The <i>stomach</i> is large,
without cæca, but with some internal longitudinal plaits
(in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> at least), showing a tendency to the
formation of cæca. In the stomach of <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> I found
a considerable quantity of a conferva, too much, I think, to
have got in accidentally.</p>

<p><i>Generative system.</i>—The vesiculæ seminales are large;
and at their broad blunt ends, in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, four separate
vasa deferentia enter, of which fact I have seen no other
instance. The ovarian tubes do not extend up the sides of
the sack, but lie at the bottom, over the basal membrane;
in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> they send six short ray-like prolongations<a name="Page_411" id="Page_411" href="#Page_411"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 411]</span></a>
into the six sutures; in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> they send similar prolongations
into the sutures, and fill up, as I believe, the six
chambers (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>, <i>v</i>) lying between the radii and alæ:
I have examined only one specimen of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> in spirits,
and this had the ovarian tubes in an early state of development,
when they can with difficulty be distinguished from
the pulpy corium; the orange-coloured masses, however,
which filled the six cavities, resembled the layer which certainly
consisted of undeveloped ovarian tubes and cæca,
lying over the basal membrane. The ova are wonderfully
numerous; their length is 3/400ths of an inch. The larvæ
have been noticed in the anatomical introduction.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ.</i>—These are immensely developed, covering
almost four fifths of the area of each side of the sack.
Each consists of two nearly equal folds, attached vertically
to the carinal end of the sack, and transversely across
the upper end extending to the animal's body. The outline
of the free part is rounded. Both folds of both branchiæ
are deeply plicated on both sides; hence the superficies of
the whole is very great. We shall find that this structure
is common to the three following allied genera, but with
these exceptions, I have observed double branchiæ only in
one species of one other genus, namely, in <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>Chthamalus
dentatus</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Attachment.</i>—The shells adhere with remarkable strength
to the whale's skin. Having, until recently, examined
only separated specimens, and observing portions of the
whale's skin adhering to the outside, and solidly filling up the
cavities on the under side, I did not doubt that the shell
had the power of forming, by its own action, a deep cavity
in the skin of the whale. Inspection of the basal outline of
the walls of the shell (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f05">5</a>) of <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, will
show how singularly unfitted its structure is for any burrowing
process; and I was led to speculate on the possibility
of the pupa being able to bury itself deeply in the
skin, but rejected this view as opposed to what is known
of the habits and structure of the pupæ of other Cirripedes.
Having now examined several specimens of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>
adhering, in a group, to a large piece of skin, in Mr.
Stutchbury's collection, it has become evident that the<a name="Page_412" id="Page_412" href="#Page_412"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 412]</span></a>
attachment is as much owing to the upward growth of the
whale's skin, as to the downward growth of the <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>.
In Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f04">4</a>, a vertical section is given of the whale's
skin, taken through the place whence a shell of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>
has been removed; consequently we here see nothing but
the whale's skin: the upper black layer is the dark horn-coloured
epidermis, forming the general surface of the
whale's body, and resting on an orange-coloured fibrous
layer, which is lightly shaded in the drawing. The two
horns in the section are two of the eighteen projections,
formed entirely of the dark epidermic layer, which fill up
the eighteen flattened cavities produced by the folding of
the walls. Outside the horns we see the section of a circular
furrow, in which the circumferential margin of the shell was
lodged; and between the horns, there is the central hollow,
within which, when lined with shell, the cirripede's body
was included. The circular furrow is formed in main part
by the epidermic layer being thinner there than on either
side, and partly by the orange-coloured, underlying fibrous
layer curving a little downwards, from having apparently
yielded to the pressure of the circumferential margin of the
shell. With respect to the cause of the thinness of the epidermis
under the circular furrow, I do not know how much
to attribute to mere mechanical compression or stretching,
and how much to the pressure of the shell, having checked<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[124]</span></a>
its formation. In the case of very young and small shells,
it is hardly possible that their pressure can have in any way
influenced the formation of new epidermic layers under the
thick old layers; and we must believe, at least in these cases,
that the whole effect is mechanical, the sharp basal edges of
the shell having indented the epidermis; but this is not more
surprising than that the radicle of a plant should penetrate
hard ground. Whether the indented epidermis in the circular
furrow becomes ruptured, I am not sure; ragged layers may
commonly be observed outside the shell, but it is very possible
that these may be the ends of layers of epidermis which have
been preserved by the covering of the shell, whereas, on the<a name="Page_413" id="Page_413" href="#Page_413"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 413]</span></a>
surrounding parts of the whale's body, these same layers
have been removed by disintegration. To return to the
section,—the outline of the boss of orange-coloured fibrous
tissue, under the central hollow, clearly shows that it must
have been formed by its own upward growth, for it
stands above the general surrounding level of the corresponding
layer. This same conclusion is still more obvious
with respect to the eighteen flattened prominent horns,
formed of the dark epidermis; the manner in which
the epidermis has been forced, moulded, and packed into
the eighteen flattened and curved cavities of the shell, so as
to adhere to them with considerable tenacity, is extremely
curious. The prominence of these horns is so great that it
appears to me quite impossible to account for them, excepting
by a special formation of epidermis beneath each
cavity. The basal membrane of the <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, which lies
at the bottom of the central hollow, adheres by its own
cementing apparatus; and when the larva first attaches
itself, this adhesion must be very important, as it allows
the basal edges of the shell, during their slow downward
growth, to press firmly on the whale's skin, and so slowly
indent it with the circular furrow. The final cause, probably,
of the cavities on the under side of the shell in this
genus, formed by the singularly convoluted parietes, is to
allow of the upward growth into them of the epidermis of
the whale, thus securing a firm attachment and allowing the
shell to exert a strong downward pressure, and thus effect
its partial imbedment, and protection from the enormous
force of the waves to which it must be exposed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_124_124" id="Footnote_124_124"></a><a href="#FNanchor_124_124"><span class="label">[124]</span></a> Formerly I was inclined to believe, as stated in my former volume on the
Lepadidæ, that the cement injured the true skin of the supporting animal, but
this, at least in such cases as the present, I do not now at all believe.</p></div>

<p>With respect to <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, I have seen only specimens,
preserved on shrunk and twisted whale's skin, with
the underlying fibrous layer not preserved; but the cavities
in the shell were filled by horns of epidermis, exactly as in
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>. There is, however, this difference in the attachment
of the two species, that in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, owing to
its depressed form, the circumference of the shell indents
the whale's skin, not vertically downwards, as in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>,
but very obliquely outwards; and, consequently, buries
itself much more completely, but less deeply, under a folded
and apparently ruptured flap of the epidermis. In young<a name="Page_414" id="Page_414" href="#Page_414"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 414]</span></a>
specimens, of the size of a shilling, the entire shell, with the
exception of the operculum, is thus covered up and protected
whilst young and tender.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>—The genus is found wherever
whales occur, that is, from the Arctic to the Equatorial
regions, in both hemispheres. It is asserted that sometimes
as many as a couple of hundred specimens will adhere to a
single whale. <a href="#Coronula_barbara"><i>Coronula barbara</i></a>, a form closely allied to
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, existed during the Red Crag period; and
Bronn has described some fossil specimens from Italy.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—In the wonderfully convoluted shell,—in the
parietal tubes not being either filled up by calcareous layers
or being crossed by calcareous septa,—in the outer lamina of
the shell between the longitudinal septa near the basis being
imperfect, <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> differs from all the foregoing genera; in
the two latter respects it agrees with the three following
allied genera, viz., <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>.
The equal size of all six compartments of the shell, has been
observed in very few genera besides <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. In a new
opercular membrane not being formed at each exuviation, and
in two or three of these membranes being persistent, and in
their being attached high up the sheath, this genus agrees
with the three following genera alone. In the valves tending
to be rudimentary, and in the protuberant lips of the sack-aperture,
we have a close alliance with <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>. The
muscles of the sack being spread out, and tending to lose
their transversely striated character, are great peculiarities in
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>. The simplicity
of the cement-ducts is a remarkable character, observed in
two of the following genera, but not in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>. The
double branchiæ is a peculiarity common to all four genera.
Neither the mouth nor cirri offer any new characters of
much importance in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> or in the three allied genera:
the lower teeth of the mandibles not being laterally double,
but having small intermediate teeth, is the newest feature
in the mouth.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Hab.</i>—Attached to whales in the Southern Ocean.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">Having described, under the genus, in so much detail
the structure of the whole shell, it will be sufficient here to
point out the characters by which this species differs from
the others.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shell is generally much depressed, though
sometimes, in large specimens, from the turning in of the basal edges, a
considerable degree of convexity is acquired. The radii are moderately
wide, and give a star-like appearance to the shell. The surface of the
whole upper part of the shell is smooth; the broad and much flattened
ribs (<i>i. e.</i> the terminal, transverse loops of the folded walls) of which
each compartment is formed, generally divide at a short distance from
the apex. The close sutures separating these ribs are straight, and not
finely serrated, by which character alone this species can at once be
discriminated from the others. The surface, when closely examined,
is found to be finely striated longitudinally, and is transversely crossed,
chiefly in the lower part, by minutely beaded growth-ridges. The
orifice is rounded-hexagonal, and is small compared with the whole
shell; it is also smaller than the basal edge of the internal cavity of
the shell; consequently the whole basal edge cannot be seen through
the orifice from one point of view,—the operculum of course having
been removed. An unusually large specimen was 2.75 of an inch in<a name="Page_416" id="Page_416" href="#Page_416"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 416]</span></a>
diameter; this individual was one of the more convex varieties, and
yet its entire thickness, from top to base, was only .9 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Operculum.</i>—Having described, under the genus, the general structure
of the opercular valve, I will here only add a few details on their
shape. They are small compared with the whole extent of the opercular
membrane. The scuta (Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>, fig. <a href="#p15f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>, scutum to the left) stand near
each other at the rostral end of the aperture leading into the sack, with
their two rostral ends united by the yellowish-brown, longitudinally
plicated, horny membrane, described under the genus. The terga
(fig. <a href="#p15f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>) stand a little apart from the scuta, on the sides of nearly the
middle of the sack-aperture. The lips are protuberant and moderately
developed all round. The scuta are elongated, and a little curved; including
the upper imbedded portion, they are almost sub-triangular:
but the under growing surface is much elongated, nearly flat, with the two
ends of nearly the same width, truncated and rounded. The <i>Tergum</i>, in
rather small specimens is, if the upper imbedded portion be included,
sub-triangular, with the growing surface oval, and between one third
and one half of the length of the scutum; but in large specimens, the
tergum becomes style-formed, lying parallel to the tergal margin of the
scutum, with the growing surface proportionally much smaller, and not
above one fifth of the length of the growing surface of the scutum. Hence
we see some tendency in the tergum to become rudimentary, as it is in
the next species. The brown, horny, plicated substance in which the
terga are imbedded, extends considerably beyond the valves themselves.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Shell and Radii.</i>—I have already so fully discussed
this subject, that I will here only enumerate the points in which this
species differs from <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> and <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>reginæ</i></a>:—Firstly, the more symmetrically
folded walls (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f05">5</a>), new folds arising on both sides of
all six sutures. Secondly, the inner ends of the folded walls, which
surround the internal cavity, being almost square, but with their angles
rounded; their inner ends descend some little way beneath the basal
edge of the sheath, as low, or lower, than the circumference of the shell.
Thirdly, the external lines of junction between the transverse terminal
loops being smooth or not serrated. Fourthly, these loops being flatter
towards the outside, and being internally filled by septa (Pl. <a href="#Page_699">15</a>,
fig. <a href="#p15f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>); tubes being thus formed larger than the proper parietal pores.
Sixthly, the sutural edges of the compound radii (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f03">3</a>) being
very much broader in the inner and upper part of each compartment
than in the outer and lower part; for in the inner and upper part they
stretch from the outside of the shell to the sheath, so that the alæ
rest on them, and hence no large open cavity is left between the
radii and alæ; in the inner and upper part, also, the radii extend
down nearly to the basal edges of the folded walls. The septa, of
which the radii are formed, stand further apart than in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>
and <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>reginæ</i></a>. Seventhly, the alæ are only <span class="correction" title="In the original book: 1-5th or 1-6th">1/5th or 1/6th</span> of the thickness
of the radii, whereas in the two other species they are very much
thicker, being nearly as thick as the radii: the alæ are also here (fig. <a href="#p16f03">3</a>,
<i>a′</i>) squarer than in those two species, that is, their basal margins are
not so short compared with their upper margins; their edges present,
also, a slightly different structure. Eighthly, the basal edge of the<a name="Page_417" id="Page_417" href="#Page_417"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 417]</span></a>
sheath does not here project freely, and does not descend quite so close
to the basal membrane.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The palpi are furnished with a row, extending along the
whole basal exterior margin, of very long upwardly pointing spines; on
their upper edges there is a brush of small spines. The edge of the
labrum is clothed with extremely fine spines, and is furnished with a
few minute teeth. The mandibles have four teeth, and the lower
end is broadly rounded and coarsely spinose: the second and third
teeth are double at their points, and between the second and third, and
again between the third and fourth, there is a small intermediate tooth.</p>

<p>Regarding the <i>Cirri</i>, I have nothing especial to remark.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>—I have examined nine sets of specimens,
having localities attached to them: three from off New South Wales;
two off the Cape of Good Hope; two from the west coast of South
America; and two marked only "South Sea." Hence I am led to
conclude that this species is confined to the southern hemisphere, or if it
extends into the northern hemisphere, it is probably only in the Pacific
Ocean. I do not believe (though so stated in some works) that this
species occurs on the shores of Europe. It seems often to be associated
with <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>. Some specimens thus associated, sent by
Mr. Bennett to Professor Owen, were said to have been attached to the
<i>Balæna australis</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Shell crown-shaped, with longitudinal convex ribs, having
their edges crenated; orifice hexagonal: radii moderately
thick, very broad: terga absent or rudimentary.</i></p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—As previously remarked, owing to the fulness
of the generic description, minute details on structure, excepting those<a name="Page_418" id="Page_418" href="#Page_418"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 418]</span></a>
characteristic of the present species, need not here be given. The
crown-like shape of the shell is well expressed by its name of <i>Diadema</i>,
but the crown tends to pass into a cylinder. The radii are extremely
broad. The orifice is large, and neatly hexagonal: when the operculum
is removed the whole inside of the cup-formed shell can be seen
at once, for the flat membranous basis is much smaller than the orifice.
The under side of the shell is deeply concave. The outside of each compartment
is formed by broad, rounded, and somewhat prominent, rarely
divided, ribs (<i>i. e.</i> the transverse ends of the folded walls); these ribs
are closely united together by finely serrated lines of junction (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>,
fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a>, <i>f</i>). Their surfaces outside are delicately striated longitudinally,
and plainly crossed (more plainly than in the foregoing and the next
species) by irregular, transverse ridges, especially in the lower part of
the shell. The largest specimen which I have seen was two and a half
inches in diameter and two in height.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—These are placed close together at the rostral end of the
orifice, and are imbedded in the brownish, tough, longitudinally plicated,
horny substance, which extends far beyond both ends of the valves. In
outline (fig. <a href="#p15f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>) they are mitre-shaped, or rounded and sub-triangular,
a little curved, and more or less elongated, being most so in young
specimens; they are, however, less elongated and rather more massive
than in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>. <i>Terga</i>,—these seem entirely absent in most
specimens; but in one (fig. <a href="#p15f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>) I found a rudiment, namely, a short
thin plate of shell, barely visible to the naked eye, extending parallel
and near to the tergal margin of the scutum. The lips of the aperture
of the sack are prominent, and highly so towards the carinal end.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell and Radii.</i>—Owing to the shell not spreading
much at the base, new folds in the walls are much seldomer formed,
and therefore the external longitudinal ribs (<i>i. e.</i> the terminal transversely
elongated loops), are much seldomer divided, than in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> or
<a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>reginæ</i></a>; even rather large specimens sometimes having only the original
eighteen folds.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[125]</span></a> When new folds are formed, only one is formed on
one, viz., the rostral, side of each suture, instead of on both sides, as in
<a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>. The inner ends of the folded walls, surrounding the
basal membrane, are narrow, instead of being almost square, as in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C.
balænaris</i></a>. The lower edge of the sheath, which projects freely,
descends almost to the level of the basal edges of the walls. The
outer ends of the folded walls, forming the transverse loops, are internally
filled up solidly by calcareous matter, instead of by septa
forming tubes, as in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>. The radii (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f02">2</a>) are a
little thicker in the lower and outer than in the upper and inner part
of each compartment; in the middle, they do not reach the sheath by<a name="Page_419" id="Page_419" href="#Page_419"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 419]</span></a>
about half the thickness of the compartment, and consequently they
are separated from the plates (<i>c′′</i> in fig. <a href="#p16f01">1</a> and <a href="#p16f07">7</a>) on which the alæ rest,
by large chambers (<i>v</i> in fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>), which extend up to nearly the apices
of the compartments: the extent, however, to which the upper ends of
these chambers have been solidly filled up, varies a little. The sinuous
plates forming the main portion of the compound radii are rather
thinner and closer together than in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>. The alæ are thick,
being thickest in the middle part, and there equal the radii in thickness;
their lower margins are very short compared with their upper margins,
hence they are almost wedge-formed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_125_125" id="Footnote_125_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> These should be counted on the under side of the shell, for if counted from
the outside, the number would be thought to be twenty-four, as on the side of
each compartment bordering the radius, a half-fold has the appearance of
being a whole fold, so that in appearance six folds are added to the real number
of the folds. This caution is necessary whatever the number of real folds may
be, that is, whether or not the original eighteen folds have been increased by
subsequent plications. These remarks, also, are applicable to the other species.</p></div>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The teeth and fine hairs on the labrum are sometimes obscure,
and sometimes plain: close outside the bottom of the medial notch,
there is a small hard prominence. The palpi are broad; on their basal
exterior margins there is a short row of spines, which do not equal in
length the width of the palpi, and therefore are not so long as in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C.
balænaris</i></a>. The mandibles have five main teeth, of which the second
and third show only an obscure rudiment of being double; between
these two teeth, and between the third and fourth tooth, there is a
small intermediate tooth: the inferior angle is narrow, rounded, and
spinose. The extremity of the apodeme of the maxillæ is expanded.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—I have only to remark, that the pedicel of the first cirrus is
extremely broad, and that the rami are set on in an unusually crooked
manner: the basal segment of the shorter and broader ramus of this
cirrus has its dorsal surface produced into a plate fringed with very
fine hairs.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>—I have received only four specimens
with certain localities attached to them: namely, the Arctic Seas of
Scandinavia; the coast of the United States, and of Britain; and the
Gulf-Stream. There is also a specimen in the British Museum, sent

but a <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, procured from a floating whale in the early part of the
outward voyage, might so easily be sent home with specimens subsequently
collected in another county, that I do not as yet fully admit
that this species is an inhabitant of the Southern Pacific Ocean: I am
less willing to admit this, from suspecting that <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>C. reginæ</i></a> in the Pacific,

<p class="p2">I have seen eight specimens of this form—two in Mr.
Cuming's collection, one of which was procured at Iquique
in Peru, the other from an unknown locality; one was given
me in Chile, and was stated to have come from the Pacific;
two others are in Mr. Stutchbury's collection, from unknown
but distinct localities, and three in a group in the
British Museum. These eight specimens, of which six were
collected separately, all strikingly agree in general aspect
and in details of structure, so that I can easily recognise the
shell, and can at once pick out a single compartment, when
mingled with those of the two foregoing species; nevertheless,
the differences are so small, that I at first hesitated
whether to name the species; but, upon reflection, I am
convinced that it is distinct. <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>Coronula reginæ</i></a> is much
more closely related to <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> than to <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>,
and I suspect that it replaces in the Pacific the former of
these two species.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance</i>; shell conical, straight-sided; some specimens
being nearly as much depressed as <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, and considerably more
depressed than any variety of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>; other specimens being
globulo-conical, but rather less globular than the ordinary form of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C.
diadema</i></a>. I may here remark, that shape is of more value in this
genus, in which the shell is attached to the yielding skin of whales,
than in those genera in which it adheres to rocks. The orifice is neatly
hexagonal, and the whole internal cavity, when the opercular membrane
is removed, can be seen from one point of view, owing to the
contraction of the lower part of the cavity and small size of the basal
membrane. The surface of the shell is smooth, but has, even up to
the summit, a peculiar frosted appearance, different from that of the
foregoing species, caused by the longitudinal striæ being rather more
distinct, and being crossed by beaded, very delicate transverse lines of
growth. The ends of the transverse loops, forming the exterior surfaces
of the compartments, are much flattened, even more so than in
<a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>. The lines of junction between the loops, are finely
serrated, as in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>; and internally they are solidly filled up,
instead of being formed into a set of tubes by longitudinal septa, as in
<a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>. The under side of the shell, with its folded walls, presents
an appearance intermediate between the variable appearance of
this part in the above two species.</p>

<p>The sutural edges of the radii (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f04">4</a>) offer by far the most
remarkable character, in their thinness from top to bottom; for they
hardly exceed one fifth of the thickness of the compartment, measured
from the external surface to the base of the sheath; hence a very large
cavity is left between the radii and alæ: in the thickness of the radii
the three species already described form a series, <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>C. reginæ</i></a> at one<a name="Page_421" id="Page_421" href="#Page_421"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 421]</span></a>
end and <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> at the other. The sinuous plates, forming the
lower part of the radius, are coarser and stand rather further apart
than in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>. The alæ are thick, and have the same outline,
being narrow at their basal margins and broad at top, as in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>,
with their sutural edges similarly constructed: the basal edge of the
sheath likewise projects freely.</p>

<p><i>Operculum.</i>—This resembles most closely that of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>. There
are no rudiments of terga. The scuta cannot be distinguished from
those of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The labrum has a row of inwardly curved little teeth along
the whole crest, and these I did not notice in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>: there is only
a trace of the prominence on the outside at the bottom of the central
notch. The hairs on the basal exterior margin of the palpi are moderately
long. The mandibles have five teeth. In the <i>Cirri</i>, the first
pair resembles in its peculiar structure those of <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>. In the
sixth pair, however, the segments support only three pairs of main
spines: but the specimen was not very large, and probably in old
specimens there would have been four pairs.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i>—The present species differs from both the foregoing only
in its rather more conical and straight-sided outline, smooth, frosted
surface, and in the narrowness of the sutural edges of the radii, and
consequent large size of the chambers between the radii and alæ. It
resembles <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, as far as the shell is concerned, in the external
ribs or transverse loops having their lines of junction serrated and
in being solidly filled up—in the shape of the orifice and of the
internal cavity of the shell—in the shape and structure of the alæ—and
in the basal edge of the sheath being free. It comes nearer to
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> than to <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> in the structure of the radii. It
differs from <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, and comes nearer to <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, in the external
ribs being flattened, instead of being convex, and in the lines
of growth being very delicate. But as it resembles <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> in the
several foregoing characters of its shell, in the opercular valves, in all
parts of the mouth (excepting the labrum), and in the cirri, it is very
much more nearly related to that species than to <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">The species here described, though near to <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>
and easily confounded with it, I have no doubt is distinct. I
owe to the kindness of the Rev. Mr. Image an examination
of the original specimen figured by Parkinson; and in Mr.
Stutchbury's collection there is a similar and more perfect
specimen; both of these resemble <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> in general
form, but have been too much worn to be positively identified.
The following description is drawn up from some
compartments collected by Mr. Searles Wood, belonging
certainly to three, and probably to four individuals, one of
which was young; as these specimens agree in all essential
respects, I feel pretty confident that the characters, by which
the present species differs from <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, are of specific
value.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>Structure of Shell.</i>—The longitudinal ribs on each compartment
(<i>i. e.</i> the terminal transverse loops), are convex and prominent, as in
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, but they are crossed by more prominent ridges of growth
than even in the roughest varieties of that species, so that the surface
of the shell is more rugged. In the three previous species, the surface
of the wall entirely round the cavities occupied by the whale's skin,
is striated only by longitudinal very fine lines; but here, the outer portion,
or that (fig. <a href="#p16f06">6</a>) formed by each transverse loop, is crossed by transverse
ridges of growth, like, but less prominent than, those on the
external surface of the shell. The minute teeth, along the lines of
junction between the transverse loops, are here less regular, and can
hardly be said to exist; for the two edges are locked together by what
may be more strictly called minute zig-zag ridges than teeth. The
exact number of the circumferential plications in the walls is variable
in the same manner as in the three foregoing species. The sutural
edges of the radii are about as thick as, or rather thicker than, in
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>. As in this latter species, and in <a href="#Coronula_reginae"><i>C. reginæ</i></a>, each ala
rests, not on the internal surface (as in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, and in all
other <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>) of the radius, but on a special plate; but in <a href="#Coronula_barbara"><i>C.
barbara</i></a>, instead of a deep chamber, running up to the apex of the
compartment, being left between the radius and ala, this part is filled
up almost entirely by solid shell. Although the extent to which this
chamber is filled up varies a little, and although its depth varies a little
in <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, yet there is a marked difference between the specimens
of this latter species, in which the chamber is most filled up, and those
of <a href="#Coronula_barbara"><i>C. barbara</i></a>, in which it is least filled up. The alæ are thick, as in
<a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a>, and their sutural edges have a central ridge, sending off
on both sides sinuous ridges. The basal margins of the alæ are not
short compared with their upper margins, and therefore the whole ala
is not wedge-formed; and in this rather important respect <a href="#Coronula_barbara"><i>C. barbara</i></a>
resembles <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f03">3</a>), and differs from <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423" href="#Page_423"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 423]</span></a>
(fig. <a href="#p16f02">2</a>). The lower edge of the sheath does not seem to have projected
freely,—in this respect, also, resembling <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>. From the
basal margin of the alæ not being narrow, and from the inner ends
of the folded walls being, as it would appear, also broad, I have
little doubt that the cavity in which the animal's body was lodged,
resembled in shape that in <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C. balænaris</i></a>, the membranous basis being
larger than the orifice of the shell.</p>

<p>Opercular valves unknown.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i>—This species is more nearly related to <a href="#Coronula_Diadema"><i>C. diadema</i></a> than
to the others; but in some points, just specified, it resembles <a href="#Coronula_balaenaris"><i>C.
balænaris</i></a>. The characters by which it differs from all the species are,
firstly, the more prominent transverse ridges on the external surface of
the shell, and more especially on the surfaces bounding the outer sides
of the cavities occupied by the epidermis of the whale. Secondly, the
character of the teeth, or rather ridges, along the lines of junction between
the transverse loops. And, thirdly, the spaces between the radii
and the plates on which the alæ rest, being solidly filled up.</p>

<p>The <i>Coronula bifida</i> is an Italian tertiary species, so
named by Bronn, in his "Italiens Tertiär-Gebilde"
(1831), p. 126. It is very possible that this may be
identical with <a href="#Coronula_barbara"><i>C. barbara</i></a>, but Bronn does not seem to have
been aware of the absolute necessity of giving minute details
in his descriptions of fossil cirripedes. The chief character
of <i>C. bifida</i> is thus given:—"Eine tiefe <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Furcle">Furche</span> oder Spalte
theilt die Längenrippe von oben herab bis zur <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Halfte">Hälfte</span>,
welche bei der sonst ähnlichen <i>C. diadema</i> entweder ganz
fehlt, oder nur zuweilen kurz angedeutet ist." Had it been
stated that the longitudinal ribs were divided from the
middle down to the base, instead of from the top to the
middle, the description would have been intelligible to me,
though the character thus afforded would not have been of
specific value, as this dividing of the ribs occasionally occurs
in all four species, and is produced by the formation of new
folds to the walls.</p>

<p class="p2">This small genus, consisting of three species (though I
have named only two), is a very natural one, yet closely
allied to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. Most authors have united these genera,
but in doing so they destroy two very natural little groups.
<a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, moreover, when all its characters are considered,
has as good a claim to be generically separated from <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>,
as has <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>,—a genus universally admitted. I
shall presently recur to this subject.</p>

<p><i>General Appearance.</i>—The most remarkable character,
and which gives a peculiar aspect to the whole shell, is that
each of the six compartments has a medial fissure or fold;
the shell thus consisting of twelve lobes. Each fold extends
from the summit to the base of the shell, and is produced
inwards in the shape of a midrib (Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>, fig. <a href="#p17f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>). The membranous
basis is supported by the basal edges of the six midribs,
and is thus rendered convex. As the midrib on the
rostrum would have interfered, if fully developed, with that
part of the animal's thorax which I have called the prosoma,
it is of less size than the other midribs; and from this same
cause the whole <span class="correction" title="In the original book: rostum">rostrum</span> is pushed a little on one side, generally
to the left, so that the shell is not perfectly symmetrical.
The midrib of the carina is less than the lateral midribs.
The orifice is oval, and is more or less plainly indented by
six angular points,—the worn-down summits of the six midribs.
The narrow elongated opercular valves stretch from<a name="Page_425" id="Page_425" href="#Page_425"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 425]</span></a>
one end of the orifice to the other. The rostrum is much
broader than the carina: the lateral compartments are but
little broader than the carino-lateral compartments. The
radii are narrow, though variable in width. The general
shape of the shell varies much in the same species, being
either much depressed, or rather steeply conical; either circular,
or more commonly oval. The (so called) epidermis is
usually persistent in the lower part of the shell. The shell
itself is white. The basal diameter of the largest specimen
of <a href="#Platylepas_bissexlobata"><i>P. bissexlobata</i></a> was nearly three-quarters of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Parietes, Radii, &amp;c.</i>—The walls of the
shell in <a href="#Platylepas_bissexlobata"><i>P. bissexlobata</i></a> are permeated by minute pores, and
have exactly the same structure as in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>; the pores
being completed by the union of ledges on the outer sides
of the longitudinal septa, and the latter have little knobs
formed on them at each period of growth. In <a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>P. decorata</i></a>
the walls are solid. Each compartment, as already stated,
has a deep nearly medial furrow, the sides of which are
closely pressed together, thus forming the midribs, and
thus differing from the furrows in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, which not being
pressed together, form cavities on the under side of the
shell. The inner longitudinal margin of each midrib is
thickly coated by a layer of shell, and is thus rendered much
more prominent than it would have been if formed exclusively
by the inward folding of the wall. The upper part of
each midrib forms a slight, longitudinal ridge (fig. <a href="#p17f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>) on
the sheath, having become encased by the sheath during its
downward growth. Owing to the small size of the midrib
of the rostrum, there is scarcely any ridge on the sheath
of this compartment. The sheath does not descend half-way
down the walls in <a href="#Platylepas_bissexlobata"><i>P. bissexlobata</i></a>, but further down
in <a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>P. decorata</i></a>; but perhaps the thickened inner margins
of the midribs may be considered as the downward prolongations
of the sheath, and on this view the sheath descends
actually to the basal membrane. The radii are
narrow: their edges have simple septa, with the interspaces
filled up solidly. The alæ have their sutural edges
smooth.</p>

<p>The <i>Basis</i> is membranous, and more or less convex.
This convexity is rendered possible by the support afforded<a name="Page_426" id="Page_426" href="#Page_426"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 426]</span></a>
by the basal edges of the six midribs. The so-called
epidermis or membrane which covers the shell, is prolonged
in six flaps under the midribs; and hence the proper basal
membrane has six deep indentations, receiving the above
flaps. The cementing apparatus is constructed on the same
simple type as in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, as has been described in the
<a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>.</p>

<p><i>Scuta and Terga.</i>—These are narrow and long, stretching
the whole length of the orifice of the shell. The two
valves touch each other, but are not properly articulated
together: their upper surfaces scale off in layers: they
resemble each other very closely in shape (fig. <a href="#p17f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>), being
simply oblong. The membrane covering the valves supports
some very minute spines, 2/1000th of an inch in length.
When a portion of valve is dissolved in acid it is seen
to be penetrated by very numerous tubuli. The opercular
membrane is rather thick: in <a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>P. decorata</i></a> I found it
occasionally double; in this species it supports some
very minute spines; it is attached about one third down
the sheath, of which the upper part is not marked (as
in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>) by regular concentric rings. The aperture between
the valves, leading into the sack, has protuberant
lips, as in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>. The normal five
bundles of muscles surrounding the sack, differently from
in the two genera just mentioned, do not thin out and
spread out downwards, but retaining their full thickness,
reach the basal membrane, to which they are attached.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: the parts present no difference from those in
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>; between the outer maxillæ we have the same
small flattened mentum-like projection; and in the mandibles,
the same small intermediate teeth between the second
and third, and between the third and fourth main teeth, as in
that genus. The main teeth here are more plainly double
laterally. There are teeth on each side of the central notch
of the labrum. The cirri differ little from those of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>,
but the segments are not nearly so much flattened
and broad, and the second and third pairs are not so short.
The segments of the sixth pair support four pairs of main
spines, with a few minute intermediate spines, but with no
intermediate tuft.</p>

<p><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427" href="#Page_427"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 427]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Branchiæ</i>: these consist on each side (at least in <a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>P.
decorata</i></a>) of a double fold, much less plicated than in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>;
the fold nearest to the animal's body is rounder, and
not quite so large as the outer fold.</p>

<p><i>Range and Habits.</i>—The <a href="#Platylepas_bissexlobata"><i>P. bissexlobata</i></a> ranges from
the Mediterranean and west coast of Africa to the West
Indies, to the north-east coast of Australia, and, judging
from the name given by Chenu, to California: the second
species, <a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>P. decorata</i></a>, inhabits the Pacific Ocean; and the
third imperfectly known species, was deeply buried in the
skin of a sea-snake, off Borneo. The <a href="#Platylepas_bissexlobata"><i>P. bissexlobata</i></a> is
attached both to turtles and to the skin of the manatee:
some specimens in the British Museum, attached to the
latter, from the west coast of Africa, were entirely buried in
the skin, with the exception of the operculum. The specimens
of <a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>P. decorata</i></a>, which I obtained at the Galapagos
Archipelago, were buried about half their depth in the softer
parts of the skin of the green turtle. I do not doubt that
the imbedment is effected in the same manner as in the
case of <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This genus, in general structure and habits,
approaches closely to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>; but it differs from all the
species of that genus in the following respects, which
appears to me fully to justify its generic separation:—The
outline is often oval, instead of circular; the compartments
are not of equal sizes and shapes; each compartment has
here only one inward furrow or fold, and this has its sides
pressed closely together, and is encased, but not obliterated,
by the sheath; the rostrum is not quite medial; and the
radii are narrow and nearly solid. The opercular valves,
again, are here more developed, and their microscopical
structure is different. The opercular membrane is less
constantly double; and, what is much more important, the
muscles of the sack are not here spread out, and show no
tendency to become rudimentary and lose their transverse
striæ. The cirri differ only in not being so broad and
flattened. The branchiæ are not quite so much developed.
Finally, I may add, that in several of the above respects in
which <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a> differs from <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, it approaches ordinary
sessile cirripedes.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell generally much depressed, and broadly
oval or circular; sometimes steeply conical. Orifice oval, generally
not large. Surface rather plainly marked by closely approximate
lines of growth, which with the lobed outline gives to the whole an
elegantly sculptured appearance: occasionally the longitudinal ridges
formed by the parietal septa are distinct. Basal diameter of largest
specimen three quarters of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell.</i>—I have nothing material to add to the generic
description. The midribs are not so prominent as in the following
species, and hence the basal membrane is less convex. The origin
of the midrib as a fold is very plain. The sheath descends barely
half-way down the walls, and is a little hollow on its under margin, on
each side of the midrib. Beneath the sheath the parietes are finely
ribbed (fig. <a href="#p17f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>), but to a variable degree. I may here remark, that in
the specimens taken from manatee, on the coast of Africa and at
Honduras, the internal ribs extended further up and were plainer, and
the opercular valves seemed to be a little narrower than in the other
specimens, so that I at first suspected that they were specifically distinct,
but I could make out no other than these small and variable
points of difference.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: oblong (fig. <a href="#p17f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>), about twice as long as broad, with the<a name="Page_429" id="Page_429" href="#Page_429"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 429]</span></a>
rostral end rounded, rather narrower than the other end, and curled
a little inwards. <i>Terga</i>, of nearly the same shape and nearly as long
as the scuta: the carinal end is rather more pointed than the scutal
end of the valve, and when viewed internally, the growing surface of
this end is seen to be bluntly pointed. In both valves the upper layers
of shell usually scale off.</p>

<p><i>Mouth and Cirri.</i> The only differences, compared with the following
species, that I perceived, were that the hairs at the end of the palpi
were here rather longer, and the fourth tooth in the mandibles rather
less distinct. The rami of the first cirrus are very unequal in length.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance and Structure.</i>—Shell oval, with the orifice large.
The walls are thick, and of less height from top to base than in the last
species. The surface (and this is the chief external character) is
marked by fine longitudinal ridges, each of which, when closely examined,
is found to be double (fig. <a href="#p17f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>), and near the basis, where not
abraded, to be ornamented with minute beads on each side: these
beads are largest on those ridges which border the sutures. The
parietes are not permeated by pores; on their inner surfaces there are
a few rather prominent but short ridges, instead of the many finer
ridges, as in <a href="#Platylepas_bissexlobata"><i>P. bissexlobata</i></a>. The sheath is of great thickness; in
young specimens layers scale off its summit, all round the shell, as in
<a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>; it is only slightly hollowed out at its lower margin; it
descends more than half-way down the walls. The midribs, formed
by the folded walls, are more prominent than in the last species, and
descend lower down; hence the basal membrane is more convex than
in the last species, for it projects downwards as much as the shell projects
upwards. In medium-sized specimens, the midribs project inwards
to a distance exceeding half the breadth of a compartment. A less
proportional length of the midrib, in an inward direction, is formed by
the inward folding of the wall, and a greater length by the thickening
of its inner longitudinal margin, than in the last species. The basal
edge of the inner end of the midrib is smooth.</p>

<p><i>Dimensions.</i>—The average size of the numerous specimens which I
obtained at the Galapagos Islands was about .2 of an inch in diameter,
and I found none larger; but Mr. Cuming's specimens from Lord
Hood's Island are half an inch in diameter.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves.</i>—These closely resemble those of the former<a name="Page_430" id="Page_430" href="#Page_430"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 430]</span></a>
species, with the exception that the carinal end of the growing or under
surface of the Tergum is much squarer.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The only difference which I could perceive was, that the
rami of the first pair were not quite so unequal in length.</p>

<p class="p2">I am indebted to Dr. Gray for a single specimen of this
supposed species, but as it is very young and imperfect,
wanting the opercular valves and cirri, I do not choose to
name it. The shell presents all the usual characters of the
genus; the rostrum, I may remark, being pushed to the
left side. The parietes are permeated by pores of considerable
size, which shows that the species is distinct from
<a href="#Platylepas_decorata"><i>P. decorata</i></a>. On the inner basal surfaces of the walls,
there are two or three very distinct ridges on each side of
the midrib; and this fact, together with the size of the
parietal pores, makes me suspect that it is not an immature
specimen of <a href="#Platylepas_bissexlobata"><i>P. bissexlobata</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2">This genus is closely allied to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, and perhaps De
Blainville was right in uniting them. But <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, as it
now stands, is so natural a genus, that it seems a pity that a<a name="Page_431" id="Page_431" href="#Page_431"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 431]</span></a>
form so entirely different in general aspect, as <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>,
should be forced into it. The main difference between
these genera consists in the walls being here not folded, in
the simpler radii, and in the general shape of the shell and
of the included animal's body; but there are many other
minor points of difference. The most novel character in
<a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> consists in the shell being lined almost close
down to the basis by the opercular membrane. In the
opercular membrane thus forming a long tube, and in the
general shape of the animal's body, we shall presently see
that <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> is closely related to <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>. In
numerous other respects <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Tubinicella">Tubicinella</span></a> is almost equally allied
to the latter genus, to <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, and to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. Finally,
several points of structure indicate that <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> may be
considered as a <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, with the shell much simplified in
structure.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell elongated, sub-cylindrical, with the
upper end rather wider than the lower, and therefore widening in a
direction the reverse of that usual with <span class="correction" title="In the original book: sessile-cirripedes">sessile cirripedes</span>. The shell is
often a little bent to one or the other side: it is surrounded by from
two or three to about ten very prominent, strong, blunt ridges or belts,
placed at rather irregular distances from each other. The surface is
finely striated longitudinally. The six compartments are of nearly
equal sizes and shapes. In full-grown specimens the parietes are not
wider at the base, and often they are even a little narrower, than at
the summit of the shell: in young specimens the parietes do widen a
little downwards. The radii are narrow; but in young specimens
they are proportionably much broader (Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>, fig. <a href="#p17f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>) than in old
specimens. The whole compartment, including the radius and wall,
is always a little wider at the summit than at the base, in accordance
with the shape of the whole shell. The operculum consists of four
nearly equal-sized, similar valves, projecting above the upper end of
the shell, which is always broken and jagged: the valves are united to
the sheath by a very thick, much folded membrane. The aperture leading
into the sack is bordered by very prominent lips, projecting above the
opercular valves; the latter have their upper layers always scaled off.
The shell is imbedded in the whale's skin up to the level of its operculum.
The largest specimen which I have seen was barely one inch
(.95) in diameter at the summit, and 1.5 in length; the longest specimen
which I have seen scarcely attained a length of one inch and three
quarters.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Shell.</i>—The parietes are thin, and if the sheath
(which extends to near the basis) be removed, they are rendered extremely
thin. They are formed by an outer and inner lamina, united
by fine longitudinal septa, projecting at the basis beyond the laminæ.
The pores thus produced (which in a transverse section are oblong in
outline), run up to the summit of the shell, and are not filled up by
shelly matter; but I presume that the included tubular threads of
corium are protected, at the broken upper end of the shell, by transverse
membranous septa. The outer lamina of shell, as in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>,
is formed, though obscurely, by the union of ledges projecting from
the longitudinal septa. The circular prominent belts, surrounding the
shell, are formed by the longitudinal septa, at certain, irregular and
rather distant periods, growing outwards; the wall at each belt being
increased to nearly twice its thickness in other parts. At each belt the
threads of corium within the parietal pores lend off minute branches
to supply the thickened wall. These belts, which continuously surround
the shell, correspond (as is best seen in young specimens), with
the little knobs or beads, which, in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f04">4</a>), rise
separately, and not quite regularly, on the longitudinal parietal septa,
and which, I believe, are formed at every successive period of growth;
here they are much larger, stand in straight transverse rows, become
confluent, and are formed only at occasional intervals. The whole
external surface of the shell is covered by membrane, stronger and more
persistent than is usual with most cirripedes.</p>

<p>Internally the sheath extends almost to the basis of the much elon<a name="Page_433" id="Page_433" href="#Page_433"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 433]</span></a>gated
shell, and terminates in a slight shoulder: it is divided as in
common <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, and differently from in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, into zones of
growth, but these are very broad; at the upper end of the shell, which,
as will hereafter be explained, is always breaking away, the sheath
readily yields along the oblique planes, which separate the zones of
growth and dip outwards: a similar but less strongly marked structure
occurs in <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, and in no other genus. We shall presently see
that the sheath presents a much more anomalous character, in being
lined down to its basal edge by the innermost and last-formed layers of
the opercular membrane.</p>

<p><i>Radii.</i>—The radii are narrow. The belts which surround the shell
are prolonged, with slightly diminished prominence, across the radii,
their formation being simply due to the radii being here thicker than in
other parts. It can be seen more plainly in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, than in other
<a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, that the membrane externally investing the shell, splits along
the radii during the diametric growth of the shell, and is continually
repaired and added to along these lines by new longitudinal slips of
membrane. The radius consists (as usual) of an inner and outer lamina,
which latter does not extend quite to the line of suture—a slightly gaping
fissure being thus left. The two laminæ are connected by septa, which
are not denticulated, but near the outer lamina bi- or tri-furcate, and
the ends of the branches thus formed spread out, forming a sort of outer
scalloped lamina, in advance of the true outer lamina. The fine
threads of corium running between these septa, do not spring, as in all
common cirripedes, from a fillet of corium occupying the actual suture,
but from two nearly circular threads of corium occupying two tubes,
which run along the line of junction between the radius and the compartment
whence it springs. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> alone we have a nearly
similar structure; for the fine threads of corium occupying the <i>proper</i>
radius, spring from a <i>single</i> very minute tube (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f07">7</a>, <i>d′</i>),
occupying the same position with the <i>two</i> tubes in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>. I may
further add, that the structure of the proper radius in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> is
precisely the same as here just described, but being on so very minute
a scale, I did not there describe it so carefully as I have here done.</p>

<p><i>Alæ</i>: these are only remarkable from their extreme thinness; for they
are not thicker than the inner lamina of the radius. Their sutural
edges are quite smooth. Forming part of the sheath, they extend
down close to the basis of the shell; where, instead of, as in general,
ending abruptly in a rectangular shoulder, they slope off into their own
compartment.</p>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—The basal membrane is complicated, owing to the shell, when
full-grown, barely, or not at all, increasing in diameter, and, in consequence,
membrane after membrane, each with its own cement-ducts
attached to it, are thrown down one nearly over the other. In the
<a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a> (p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>—Pl. <a href="#Page_712">28</a>, fig. <a href="#p28f03">3</a>), I have fully described the
cementing apparatus, which is very curious from one of the ducts
always having a loop with two spurs projecting from it. The basal
membrane does not equal in diameter the base of the shell, for the membrane
externally covering the walls is inflected inwards all round for
a considerable width, and is then united to the basal membrane: in<a name="Page_434" id="Page_434" href="#Page_434"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 434]</span></a>
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, the basal membrane extends only under the internal cavity
of the shell, and not under the folded walls, and therefore presents a
somewhat analogous structure.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves.</i>—The scuta and terga are nearly of the same size
and shape: they are mitre-formed, and higher than broad. They do
not fill up the orifice of the shell. The scutum is a little larger than
the tergum, and rather less symmetrical, the rostral corner of the valve
being a little produced. There is no hollow or crest for the adductor
muscle, which is small. In the tergum there is no trace of a spur.
The two valves are not articulated together, but standing close to each
other are united, as well as the scutum to the scutum, and tergum to
the tergum, by thick, brown, tough, yet soft membrane, in layers continuous
with, but differing in appearance from, the surrounding opercular
membrane. The layers of shell, forming the valves, are thick, and
only the three or four lower layers are usually preserved, the upper ones
having symmetrically scaled off, leaving snow-white surfaces. Owing
to the thickness of the successive shelly layers, and to the circumstance
of each new layer being but very little larger than the last, the scaling
off of the old upper layers is a quite necessary process; for otherwise
the orifice into the sack would have been encumbered and almost closed
by four long, slightly tapering points, prolonged upwards from the
basal layers that form the four existing valves. The same scaling off
process takes place in <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, and amongst pedunculated cirripedes
in Lithotrya. Microscopical examination does not exhibit any fine
spines on the membrane investing the valves, or any tubuli in the
shelly layers after their dissolution in acid: in this respect the valves
resemble those of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>. The summits of the valves project freely
for about a third of their own height, above the level of the membrane
by which they are surrounded. The orifice leading into the sack is bordered
by very protuberant lips, standing up even considerably above
the upper freely projecting portions of the valves.</p>

<p>The <i>Opercular Membrane</i>, connecting the valves and the top of the
shell, is thick and tough, and deeply folded in concentric wrinkles. As
in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, it consists of two or three separate membranes (each composed
of many laminæ) one over the other, united to successive shelly
layers of the opercular valves. As the upper shelly layer scales off,
the membrane attached to it is likewise thrown off. The innermost
laminæ of the last-formed opercular membrane extend down, closely
attached to the sheath, to its basal edge, and therefore nearly to the
basis of the shell; the outer and older laminæ, all closely attached one
within the other and to the sheath, extend to a less and less distance
downwards; consequently, the animal's body is enclosed in a tube,
thinning out downwards, formed by the laminæ of the successive opercular
membranes, surrounded outside by the shell: only in the following
genus, <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, shall we meet with a nearly analogous
structure. As the shell of <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> increases in diameter, from the
growth of the radii, the opercular membrane lining the sheath is necessarily
split along the six lines of suture, in the same manner as is the
membrane externally investing the shell; in a like manner, also, it is
repaired and added to by new longitudinal slips of membrane. Of<a name="Page_435" id="Page_435" href="#Page_435"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 435]</span></a>
this structure, in the opercular membrane, I have seen no other instance;
for in most genera the old opercular membrane is moulted,
and a new and larger one formed at each period of growth; in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>,
in which the opercular membrane is likewise for a time persistent,
it does not run far down the inside of the shell, and each new membrane
is formed large and extensible, so as to allow, without splitting,
of some increase in the diameter of the shell. The opercular membrane
at the summit of the shell, in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, is folded in concentric
lines, and so deeply, that the basal edges of the opercular valves are
generally hidden: this folding arises partly from each last deposited
and innermost membrane being originally formed slightly folded, but
chiefly from the rapid downward growth of the shell, and the consequent
downward movement of the whole animal's body, together with
the opercular valves to which the body is attached, and this necessarily
tends to wrinkle and fold the opercular membrane. Owing to the opercular
membrane extending far down inside the shell, and being firmly
attached to the sheath, as the upper part of the shell breaks away and
disintegrates (which we shall presently see is constantly taking place),
small particles of shell are left adherent to the circumferential and
folded parts of the opercular membrane; and this at first much perplexed
me.</p>

<p><i>Muscles of the Sack</i>: these extend down almost to the base of the
shell, but in the lower part they spread out and become thin and very
irregular, not even corresponding on the opposite sides of the body.
The fasciæ in the upper part show very distinct transverse striæ, but
lower down these become either obscure or entirely deficient. In all
these characters the muscles of <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> and <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> resemble
each other. The rostral depressor muscles of the scuta consist each
of four small bundles of fasciæ; the lateral depressores run not quite
straight down, but in a curved course towards the carinal end of the
sack: the tergal depressores are proportionally smaller than in ordinary
sessile cirripedes, but they project and form two crests (with
some fasciæ between them), which support the Branchiæ. The membrane
lining the sack, I may here mention, is unusually strong.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ.</i><a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[128]</span></a>—These are enormously developed; the two together
covering two thirds of the area of the sack. Each consists of two folds,
both deeply plicated. They are attached longitudinally to the two crests,
including and formed by the muscles running from the terga to near
the basis of the shell. The branchiæ are likewise attached transversely
to the sack, under the basal margins of the terga.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_128_128" id="Footnote_128_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_128_128"><span class="label">[128]</span></a> These have been described by Professor Owen in the second volume of the
'Descriptive Catalogue of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.'</p></div>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The labrum is very finely hirsute, without teeth; the palpi
have a short row of moderately long spines along their exterior basal
margins. The mandibles have four rather narrow, sharp teeth, which
(excepting the first) have double points: between the second and third,
and again between the third and fourth teeth, there is a single small
intermediate tooth: the inferior angle is irregularly pectinated. The<a name="Page_436" id="Page_436" href="#Page_436"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 436]</span></a>
maxillæ are small; there is a small notch beneath the two upper great
spines, and a second notch near the inferior angle. Between the outer
maxillæ, there is a square-topped mentum. Hence we see that the
mouth in all its few peculiarities, resembles that of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—These are short, with short and broad segments protuberant
in front. The pedicel of the first cirrus is very broad, and
exteriorly clothed with fine hairs: its rami are slightly unequal in
length. The second and third cirri are very short. The three posterior
pairs are remarkable from the pairs of main spines being placed so
close one under the other, and in an oblique direction, that at first
they appear to form a single crowded transverse row: the dorsal tufts
are rather large.</p>

<p><i>Body.</i>—The body is remarkable from its nearly vertical position,
and from the much elongated pyramidal form of the prosoma, extending
down nearly to the bottom of the sack. The membrane investing
the prosoma, presents a few circular folds, falsely appearing like articulations.
The œsophagus enters the stomach rather obliquely. With
respect to the generative system, I have only to remark, that the
vesiculæ seminales are of great length, and convoluted to a remarkable
degree. The ovarian cæca, form a thick layer at the bottom of the
sack; they do not appear to extend up the shell round the sack. The
only other point, which I shall here mention, is that beneath the basal
articulation of the first cirrus, there is a longitudinal swelling, ending
in a freely projecting point, .06 of an inch in length; at first, I thought,
that we here had a rudiment of a filamentary appendage like those found
in several Lepadidæ; but closer examination showed an orifice at the
apex, leading into the acoustic meatus, in which the singular, wrinkled,
heart-shaped acoustic vesicle, mentioned in the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>, hangs
suspended. Alongside the freely depending point, with an orifice at its
end, there is a smaller upward projecting point, without any orifice,
but hollow within and lined by corium; I believe it opens internally
into the acoustic meatus.</p>

<p><i>Attachment and general Growth of Shell.</i>—All the specimens which
I have seen have been attached in groups. They are buried up to the
level of the operculum in the whale's skin; and their summits, I
suspect, lie even beneath the general surface of the body of the whale.
It is certain that the shells grow much at their basal ends. As
in the case of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, the flat membranous basis does not actually
penetrate the skin; but the general pressure of the whole group of
shells seems to push inwards the skin of the whale, and directly
beneath each shell the formation of new epidermis is apparently
checked. Between the shells, however, though close together, the
epidermis continues to be formed, and is pushed upwards between them,
in the same manner as it is forced into the flattened cavities on the
under side of the shell of <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>.</p>

<p>The manner in which a full-grown shell assumes its ordinary shape,
at first appears very perplexing:<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[129]</span></a> it has to change from a cylinder, at<a name="Page_437" id="Page_437" href="#Page_437"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 437]</span></a>
first probably not much above the 1/50th of an inch in diameter, to a
cylinder nearly one inch in diameter: and this is not effected by the
growth of the radii, for the radii never reach the basis, and the basis of
course has to increase in diameter like the rest of the cylindrical shell.
The radii serve only to keep the summit of the shell wider than the
basis, which is the natural shape of this species; and in large-sized
specimens, this purpose is sometimes aided by the parietes during their
downward growth decreasing slightly in width. In ordinary nearly full-sized
specimens, the parietes are of the same width at the top and
bottom, but in some large-sized specimens, as just stated, they even
become narrower towards the bottom; as they grow only at the bottom,
one does not at first see how they can ever increase in width, or how the
older shells can have acquired their present diameter. But an examination
of young specimens, from .1 to .3 of an inch in diameter, at once
serves to show how the shell attains its full size and shape: for here
the parietes are all found to increase downwards sensibly in width,
though at a much slower ratio than in other sessile cirripedes; in
larger, but not full-grown specimens, a similar increase can by care
be detected: hence by long-continued growth at the base of the shell,
with the removal of the upper part, a young <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> of small
diameter will be converted into an old one of large diameter, retaining
during all the time its sub-cylindrical form, with its summit rather
broader than its base. With respect to the removal of the upper
part of the shell, this seems almost constantly going on, for the summit
of every specimen invariably had a freshly broken aspect. The peculiar
structure of the sheath, which is the strongest part of the shell, namely,
its division into oblique layers, separable by a slight force, doubtless is
subservient to the repeated breakage of the summit. In some species
of <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a> and of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, gradual disintegration of the upper part of
the shell is a necessary element in the growth of the animal, in order
that the orifice may increase in size, and here we have mechanical
breakage equally necessary.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_129_129" id="Footnote_129_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_129_129"><span class="label">[129]</span></a> I am indebted to Dr. J. E. Gray for calling my attention to this subject,
and explaining to me several points.</p></div>

<p>Some curious results follow from the peculiar growth of <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>
just described. At Plate <a href="#Page_701">17</a>, fig. <a href="#p17f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>, we have a careful drawing of a
lateral compartment, together with its radius, (which latter does not here
concern us), taken from a shell .2 of an inch in diameter. The two
protracted dotted lines show the form which this compartment would
have assumed, if it had continued growing downwards at the same rate
of increase in width as hitherto. But the increase in width always
seems to become less and less as the shell grows older; hence the
dotted lines, representing the wall after long-continued growth, ought
to have been drawn diverging or widening still more slowly than they
do. The lateral compartment in fig. <a href="#p17f03a">3 <i>a</i></a> is the exact size of the compartment
of a large specimen nearly one inch in diameter; in this
specimen the parietes, far from increasing in width downwards, had
commenced, as is represented, decreasing. Compartments of all intermediate
sizes between those figured at <a href="#p17f03a">3 <i>a</i></a> and <a href="#p17f03b">3 <i>b</i></a> can easily be shown
in different specimens. From these facts we may safely infer, that if
the whole growth of the compartment <a href="#p17f03a">3 <i>a</i></a> had been preserved, instead
of its upper end having been continually chipped away, it would have<a name="Page_438" id="Page_438" href="#Page_438"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 438]</span></a>
had even a more tapering form than that represented by the whole and
dotted lines in the two figures, and would have exceeded six inches in
length! this of course being also the length of the whole shell. The
young <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, of which <a href="#p17f03b">3 <i>b</i></a> is a compartment, was imbedded in the
whale's skin nearly up to the level of its operculum; if it had lived,
it would no doubt have grown to the length just specified, viz., above
six inches, but as all the growth is at the lower end, the bottom of the
shell, it might be thought, would necessarily have become buried in
the whale's skin to this same depth; and the summit of the shell, on
this same view, would have been buried to a depth by as much less as the
height or length of the old shell itself, namely, by about one inch and a
half less than the six inches. As far as I can judge from an examination
of several large groups of full-grown specimens, preserved in their imbedded
condition, the summits of the shells seem always to lie a little
beneath the surrounding level of the whale's skin, but not nearly to the
extent here just inferred. Nor can I believe that the epidermis of the
whale had ceased being formed under these specimens, whilst it had gone
on being formed all round them, to the thickness of between four and five
inches, and that it had subsequently disintegrated to this same thickness,—which
processes would account for the summit of the shell being still
on nearly a level with the surface of the whale. The view which seems
to me most probable, is, that the rapid downward growth of the shell,
besides indenting the whale's skin, at the same time slowly pushes the
whole shell out of the skin, and thus continually exposes the summit to
the wear and breakage which seems to be necessary for its existence.
On this view, the very peculiar form of <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, which is retained
during life, namely, the slightly greater width at top than at bottom,
is beautifully explained, viz., for the sake of facilitating the protrusion
of the shell; for the ordinary conical shape of sessile cirripedes, with
the apex upwards, would have rendered the pushing out of an imbedded
shell almost impossible; on the other hand, we can see that the likewise
very peculiar, concentric, prominent belts may be necessary to
prevent too easy protrusion.</p>

<p><i>Fossil Species.</i>—I do not believe that this genus has hitherto been
found fossil. The <i>Tubicinella maxima</i> of Ch. Morren, said to have been
found (see Bronn, Index Palæontologicus) in the chalk of Belgium, I
have good reason to believe does not really belong to this genus.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">This Cirripede, in appearance the most anomalous of its
family, has affinities distinctly pronounced. Four years
ago the Rev. R. T. Lowe sent me some specimens, which
he had obtained from a porpoise between Madeira and
England; and I named them in MS. Siphonicella, from
their relationship to <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>,—a fact which I mention
only because Sir C. Lyell has alluded to this genus under
the above name (without any description), in his anniversary
address to the Geological Society, as have I, in my
volume (p. 156) on the Lepadidæ. Since that time Professor
Steenstrup has described and named the genus, fully
recognising its place and affinities, and has most kindly
sent me a magnificent group of specimens.</p>

<p>This genus singularly resembles, in general appearance,
some of the pedunculated Cirripedes, so much so that in
the specimens sent me by Mr. Lowe, in which the almost
rudimentary shell was, from disintegration and its deep imbedment,
not plainly visible, I did not in the least doubt
that I was examining a new genus of Lepadidæ. I may
mention, as a proof how truly all the parts and organs are
correlated in Cirripedes, that I was at first in despair when
I found a species to all appearance pedunculated, with its
labrum not bullate, its palpi of large size, its third pair of
cirri totally unlike the fourth and succeeding pairs, and with
only a single layer of muscles round the peduncle; but when,
in addition, I found that there were branchiæ, and that these
were double, I felt convinced that I was dissecting a disguised
sessile cirripede, and that its true place was near
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>: soon, I found the imbedded and almost rudimentary
shell, of which a mere fragment would equally well
have declared the true position and relationship of the whole
animal. Though <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, in external aspect, is so completely
masked, yet in its habits, namely, in living attached
on Cetaceans, as in its essential structure, it displays its
real affinities. In the course of the following description, it
will be seen that in the shell, the affinity is almost equally
close to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, but that, considering the<a name="Page_440" id="Page_440" href="#Page_440"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 440]</span></a>
whole animal, the affinity is somewhat closer to <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>.
<a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> may indeed be described as a <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>
without opercular valves,—with the opercular membrane
thickened down to the basis,—and with the shell, excepting
the few last-formed basal zones of growth, almost wholly
removed by the breakage of its upper end; this remnant
of a shell, however, presenting some strong points of
resemblance to <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shell is in an almost rudimentary condition,
and appears like a small white irregular star, imbedded up to its
top in the skin of the porpoise. Out of this thin, star-shaped shell, a
cylindrical, flexible, peduncle-formed body springs, which forms the
main part of the animal; it is narrow where coming out of the central
cavity of the star, but soon acquires its full diameter; at the upper end
it has a reflexed hood, and hence is broader, and this has the appearance
of forming a capitulum, like that of a pedunculated Cirripede.
This pseudo-capitulum is formed by a membranous reflexed collar or
hood, which is very narrow at the lower end of the orifice, close under
the mouth, and becomes wider and wider towards the upper and
carinal or posterior end of the orifice; hence the lower reflexed edge
of the hood is only slightly oblique or even nearly transverse. The
orifice leading into the sack is large, and nearly in the same straight
line with the peduncle; it is a little hollowed out in the middle at the
upper end, and on each side of this medial hollow, there is a small
rounded projection or horn, not perforated, but hollow, as may be seen
by turning up the hood and looking at its under side. These two little
horns curiously bring to mind the ear-like appendages in <i>Conchoderma
aurita</i> (<i>Otion</i>), but these latter are perforated, open into the sack, and
point outwards. The peduncle-formed body answers, as we shall
presently see, to the main part of the shell in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, and the
hood, as it would appear, to the lips of the sack-aperture, which project
between its scuta and terga; of these valves there is not here a trace.
The whole surface is smooth, and is formed by rather thin membrane,
of an orange colour; but from the colour of the underlying corium,
the whole appears of a dark chocolate red, the reflexed hood being
rather lighter coloured. It is singular how closely the colour resembles
that of some dark varieties of the above-mentioned <i>Conchoderma aurita</i>,
and likewise of <i>Anelasma squalicola</i>, both pedunculated Cirripedes,<a name="Page_441" id="Page_441" href="#Page_441"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 441]</span></a>
having oceanic habits, and destitute, to a remarkable degree, like
<a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>, of shelly valves.</p>

<p>The largest specimen which I have seen was very nearly two inches in
length: in this specimen the star-shaped shell measured, from extreme
point to point, nearly a quarter of an inch in diameter, but the internal
cavity only about one eighth of an inch. This latter measure gives
also the diameter of the peduncle, where coming out of the shell; the
diameter just beneath the hood, was in this same specimen rather
more than a quarter of an inch, and therefore greater than the diameter
of the points of the shell. The depth of the shell from the upper rim
to the basal membrane, in one specimen which I measured, was only
one twentieth of an inch, and this specimen had its pseudo-peduncle
one inch and three quarters in length, consequently thirty-five times as
long as the shell was deep.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell.</i>—The almost rudimentary shell (fig. <a href="#p17f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>) consists
of a small, thin, six-rayed disc, formed of six compartments, each of
which, instead of being outwardly convex, as in ordinary Cirripedes, is
deeply bowed inwards. The narrow sutures (<i>s s</i>) separating the six
compartments, run along the middle of the six rays, each ray being
composed of the bowed ends of the walls of the adjoining compartments.
The rays are a little curved towards the carinal end of the
shell. It is remarkable that the rostrum is smaller and less deeply
folded inwards than the other compartments, and the lateral compartments
are a little smaller than the carino-lateral compartments, which
is exactly the reverse of what is usually the case. Only about four
zones of growth have been preserved in any specimen, and consequently
the shell is very nearly of the same diameter at the top and
bottom; for the upper end of the shell is rapidly removed, as in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>,
by the scaling off of the upper rims of the sheath, and by the
disintegration of the walls. The zones of growth are commonly not
piled exactly over each other, but rather obliquely, as represented in
fig. <a href="#p17f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>. Each zone projects, forming a prominent, sharp, toothed
ridge round the shell. In <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_700">16</a>, fig. <a href="#p16f06">6</a>) and its allies, the
outer lamina of the wall is formed by the union, a little above the
basal margin, of ledges running along the sides of the longitudinal
septa. In <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>, fig. <a href="#p17f04c">4 <i>c</i></a>) similar ledges are less perfectly
joined, and apertures seem always to be left in transverse rows under
the transverse toothed ridges, which latter are best seen in fig. <a href="#p17f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>. The
apertures, of course, are covered by membrane. The transverse ridges
are surmounted by knobs arising from the longitudinal septa; and the
knobs themselves are capped by other little heads, which are not represented
in the drawing. Owing to these projections, and to the prominence
of the transverse ridges and of the longitudinal septa, the
external membrane is attached so firmly to the shell that even with
the aid of caustic potash it can hardly be separated.</p>

<p>The internal cavity of the shell is small: it approaches a hexagon in
shape, with the rostral side very short, and the lateral sides curved inwards.
It is lined by a rather thick sheath, which descends very near
to the basal membrane; the sheath is divided into very distinct, successive
convex zones of growth. The external membrane of the pseudo-<a name="Page_442" id="Page_442" href="#Page_442"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 442]</span></a>peduncle
is attached with remarkable strength to these rib-like zones
of the sheath. The alæ (<i>a</i> in fig. <a href="#p17f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>) are represented by mere angular
shoulders, received into very slight notches, and placed at the inner
ends or entrances of the double walls, or rays as I have called them.
With respect to the radii, they also are in an extremely rudimentary
condition; but a thin layer of shell, apparently continuous and homologous
with the sheath, extends from the sheath along both sides of
each ray, and on the rostral side (whence the radius ought to arise),
about half-way from the end of the ray, gives rise to a projection or
ridge (<i>d</i>, in fig. <a href="#p17f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>) which runs from the top to the base of the shallow
shell. From this longitudinal ridge, septa, parallel to the basis, extend
to nearly the extremity of the ray or double wall. These represent
the radii; but they never grow, so as to increase the diameter of the
shell. These radii evidently correspond to the additional or pseudo-radii
in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, which in that genus lie between the parallel, as here,
and folded parietes. Of the true radius, having the same thickness as
the paries, I here saw only traces in an internal, very slight, longitudinal
ridge running up the shell, close to the outer extremity of each
ray or double wall.</p>

<p>The membranous <i>Basis</i> is united all round to a rather wide flap of
membrane which is inflected from the outer surface of the shell. The
cement-glands appear to be mere enlargements of the cement-trunks,
which latter extend in two nearly straight and parallel lines. From
each gland two cement-ducts proceed, one of which runs parallel to
the cement-trunk.</p>

<p>The pseudo-peduncle, forming the main part of the animal, has, as
far as external appearance is concerned, been sufficiently described. The
part forming the hood apparently answers to the protuberant lips of the
operculum, and the lower part to the sub-cylindrical shell of <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>;
both shell and peduncle in the two genera being wider at top than at
bottom. If in imagination we chip away (an action always in progress)
the whole upper part of the shell of <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, leaving only two or three
zones of growth at the base, we shall convert it into a <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>,
with every internal part and organ occupying the same relative position:
for it should be borne in mind that the shell of <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a> is
lined close down to the basis by the opercular membrane, and this is
strictly comparable with the outer membrane of the pseudo-peduncle
of <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>. The body, as in <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, is attached in a vertical
position, with the longer axis of the thorax and of the much elongated
prosoma extending in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the
pseudo-peduncle. The point of attachment of the body to the lower
part of the hood is much elongated, but presents the usual muscles
running to near the base of the labrum and embracing the prosoma.
The adductor scutorum muscle is well developed, and is placed close
beneath the mouth, where the collar or hood commences folding over:
hence, no doubt, the lower end of the large and long orifice into the
sack can be closed by the adductor; but the upper end probably can
only be blocked up by the outer surfaces of the curled cirri. The
scuta, I may add, if such had existed, would certainly have covered the
point where the adductor muscle is attached to the exterior membrane.<a name="Page_443" id="Page_443" href="#Page_443"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 443]</span></a>
The sack extends down to within the almost rudimentary shell: the
tunic lining it is unusually strong; indeed, in the reflexed hood-like
portion, it is as strong as the properly external membrane. The latter
seems to be moulted in large strips, and not in a single piece, like the
opercular membrane in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>: just above the shell, fragments of
three or four of these outer coats are retained by their very firm attachment
to the sheath. The two layers of corium, lining the outer membrane
of the pseudo-peduncle and the inner tunic of the sack, instead of
being, as usual, united almost continuously together, stand some little
way apart, and are connected by longitudinal septa; hence, in a transverse
section, especially of the lower part, the sack is surrounded by an
irregular ring of square tubes of corium. The muscles surrounding the
sack and imbedded in the inner fold of corium, are very thinly spread
out; they branch, and even sometimes cross each other; they are more
numerous at the carinal and rostral ends, but certainly cannot be said
to form six (or five) bundles, as in all other sessile cirripedes. Some
of the fasciæ extend down to the very basis, and some up to the summit,
to near the two little horn-like projections. I could not perceive
any transverse striæ on these muscles. Altogether, they are very
weak, and cannot have much power in moving the whole peduncle-like
body.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ.</i>—These are largely developed: they are attached to two
approximate, longitudinal, fleshy crests, which extend more than half-way
down the sack, along the carinal margin. Each branchia is
double, the two folds being united where attached in a transverse line
across the sack, on a level with the attachment of the body. The
inner fold is much smaller than the outer; not extending half so far
down the sack, and not extending so far transversely; it is also hardly
at all plicated. The larger and plicated fold extends down considerably
below the lower end of the prosoma, and altogether fully equals one third
of the entire length of the animal, measured from the shell to the summit
of the orifice. Both folds are formed of very delicate membrane.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—Labrum unusually prominent, as measured from its basal
margin to the crest, which is but slightly notched, hairy, and without
teeth. Palpi broad, heart-shaped, clothed on their inner sides by a
thick brush of spines, which here, as on the other gnathites and cirri,
are almost all doubly serrated. On the outer margin of the palpi there
are a few longer spines. Mandibles villose, with five teeth, of which
the fifth is very small and of irregular shape: the inferior angle is
broad and pectinated. There are no intermediate teeth between the
second, third, and fourth teeth, as in the three foregoing genera. Had
I not known that the lower main mandibular teeth were always
laterally double in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, and had I not observed how obscure
this structure was in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, I should have overlooked
the merest vestiges of double teeth in the present genus; indeed,
in some specimens the teeth seemed to be absolutely single.
The maxillæ are villose: their edge exhibits a trace of being notched
under the two great upper spines. The outer maxillæ are bilobed, but
not very plainly: between these organs there is no little prominent
mentum, as in the three previous genera.</p>

<p><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444" href="#Page_444"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 444]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The cirri are short, particularly the three anterior pairs.
The segments in all are singular, from being so much compressed, so
short, and of such great breadth; they are protuberant in front. In
the second and third cirri, the broad <em>lateral</em> faces of the segments,
with the exception of the posterior face of the posterior ramus, are
almost bare of spines. In the three posterior pairs of cirri (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>,
fig. <a href="#p29f06">6</a>), the segments are protuberant in front, and support three pairs
of short thick spines, with an intermediate tuft; the dorsal tufts are
unusually small: their pedicels are remarkable from the upper segment,
and the upper part of the lower segment, being produced into
a rounded protuberance, dotted with spines: I have met with a similar
structure only in <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>. In the third pair (fig. <a href="#p29f05">5</a>) there
is only a trace of this structure; and in the second pair the anterior
margin of the pedicel is straight, and clothed with three tufts of bristles.
The pedicel of the first cirrus is very broad, and clasps the mouth.</p>

<p>The cirri and mouth are dark chocolate red, like the outside of the
animal and the upper part of the sack. The thorax is redder and
paler. The four posterior articulations of the thorax are straight and
transverse; the next segment, or that corresponding with the second
pair of cirri, is slightly inflected, in the usual way, towards the prosoma.
The prosoma is pale coloured, extraordinarily elongated, and
bluntly pointed; it extends down (see the dotted outline in Pl. <a href="#Page_701">17</a>,
fig. <a href="#p17f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>) about one third of the length of the whole animal. The
orifice leading into the acoustic sack forms a freely depending little
point beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus. The stomach
in the uppermost part is deeply and closely plaited longitudinally,
but has no cæca; it runs down (externally coated, as usual, by the
testes) to the lower point of the prosoma, and is then doubled back
on itself, so that it is very long.</p>

<p><i>Generative System.</i>—The probosciformed penis is short and thick,
and covered with very minute tufts of bristles: there is no knife-edged
projection at its dorsal base. The vesiculæ seminales are much convoluted
and of great length. The ovarian tubes form a small sheet
within the rudimentary shell, in the normal position, over the basal
membrane; and likewise higher up between the two folds of corium
surrounding the pseudo-peduncle; they do not, however, appear to
occur round the lower part of the peduncle: they extend highest on
the rostral and carinal sides, and lowest on the two lateral faces. The
ova are wonderfully numerous; they are 15/2000ths of an inch in length:
they form, instead of two thin lamellæ, two almost cylindrical packets,
which are held together by most feeble membrane. Each packet, in
the upper part lies between the two folds of the branchiæ; and in the
lower part, is embraced only by the larger outer fold. The two packets
of eggs sometimes cohere together at their lower ends.</p>

<p><i>Imbedment.</i>—The shell is imbedded up to its summit, but the shell
is very shallow. The imbedment seems due either to the compression
of the epidermis of the porpoise, or to its formation beneath the shell
having been checked; the outline of the true skin under the dark-coloured
epidermis is not in the least affected. The epidermis fills up the bay-like
spaces formed by the inwardly folded walls, and firmly adheres to them.</p>

<p><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445" href="#Page_445"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 445]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—This genus presents very varied affinities to <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>,
<a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a>, and <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>. To the latter it is more especially allied in
the compartments, being singly folded inwards, though the sides of
the folds are not here closely pressed together, as in <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>: in
both these genera the fold is less deep in the rostrum, of which fact,
in <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, the final cause is evident, but here there seems no cause,
excepting the simple one of affinity. <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> is further allied to
<a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>, in the lesser size of the inner fold of each branchia, compared
with the outer, and in the structure of the cement-glands, and to a
certain extent in that of the sheath. To <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> the special alliance
is shown by the remarkable character of the pseudo-radii lying between
the parallel and adjoining walls, and in the general character of the
cirri: in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> we have the terga sometimes quite aborted, and the
scuta of small size, thus exhibiting a tendency to the entire absence of
opercular valves, so remarkable in <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>. To <a href="#Genus_Tubicinella">Tubicinella</a>, the
alliance is still more plainly shown in the external shape of the whole
animal, wider at top than at bottom,—in the opercular membrane
descending almost to the very base—in the relative positions of the
different parts and organs—in the upper end of the shell continually
scaling off—in the prominence of the transverse external ridges—in the
sheath being divided into successive zones of growth, and being prolonged
nearly to the basal membrane—and in the edges of the alæ
being smooth. Internally, the resemblance is also plainly shown, in the
strength of the internal tunic of the sack—in the branchiæ springing
from two approximate fleshy crests—in the freely depending acoustic
orifices—in the form of the thorax and prosoma—and consequently of
the alimentary canal.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">Seeing the state of the almost rudimentary shell, it is not
difficult to imagine its total disappearance. Thinking of
this, it occurred to me to doubt for a few minutes, whether
Anelasma, described in my volume on the Lepadidæ, which
presents many points of resemblance with <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a>,—viz.,
in colour, in the strength of the internal membrane of the
sack, in the size of the orifice with its thin membranous margin,
in the entire absence of opercular valves, and in epizoic
habits,—might not in truth be a sessile cirripede, in an extremely
altered condition; for the cirri of Anelasma are in so
rudimentary a state, and the mouth in so modified a condition,
that the internal characters by which pedunculated cirripedes
can be distinguished from the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, though not
from the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, are almost lost. But if Anelasma
had belonged to either of the two sub-families of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>,
the sack would have penetrated almost to the bottom
of the peduncle; there would have been only a single layer
of longitudinal muscles round the peduncle; and there<a name="Page_446" id="Page_446" href="#Page_446"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 446]</span></a>
would not have existed ovigerous fræna. I believe that
Anelasma and <a href="#Genus_Xenobalanus">Xenobalanus</a> are only analogically connected,
being no more related together by true affinity, than any
other two genera in the Lepadidæ and <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Sub-Family_Chthamalinae" id="Sub-Family_Chthamalinae" /><i>Sub-Family</i>—<span class="smcap">C<span class="lowercase">HTHAMALINÆ</span></span>.</h2>

<p><i>Shell with the rostrum having alæ, but without radii:
rostro-lateral compartments without alæ on either side:
parietes not porose.</i></p>

<p><i>Mouth with the labrum bullate; palpi hardly touching
each other: third pair of cirri with the segments resembling
those of the fourth pair.</i></p>


<p class="p2">The shell in this sub-family consists of four, six, or eight
compartments, with the addition, in <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>, of several
whorls of supplemental compartments or scales, like those
forming the lower part of the capitulum in Pollicipes. The
rostrum has alæ and no radii; in shape and size it resembles
the carina. The rostro-lateral compartments are destitute of
alæ; in all cases they overlap the adjoining compartments,
and have radii (when such are developed) on both sides.
In the genus, <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, however, the shell must be looked
to very young, in order to detect this normal structure, for soon
the true rostrum and rostro-lateral compartments become
blended together, making a compound rostrum, destitute,
as in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, of alæ, but furnished with radii. The
parietes are never porose, nor furnished with regular symmetrical
ribs (representing the longitudinal parietal septa)
on their inner surfaces: sometimes, however, on the basal
internal edges, there are some irregular depending points.
In conformity with the simplicity of the parietes, the Radii
(which are seldom much developed) have likewise a simple
structure; and often are merely formed by the simple lateral
growth of the parietes. The scuta and terga are articulated
together more deeply than is usual in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>; and
the terga never have a long spur.</p>

<p><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447" href="#Page_447"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 447]</span></a></p>

<p>Looking to the animal's body. The Labrum is always
swollen and bullate, and though hollowed out, is never notched
in the middle. The Palpi are rather small, and have not their
tips nearly touching each other. The mandibles generally
have their lower main teeth laterally single, though sometimes
they are double: the inferior angle is always pectinated.
The maxillæ are always notched under the upper pair of
great spines. Of the <i>Cirri</i>, the third pair much more closely
resembles, in external structure and powers of movement,
the fourth than the second pair, though sometimes a few
of the basal segments, especially on the anterior ramus, are
thickly covered with bristles, as on the segments of the
second pair. In three species belonging to two genera,
there are caudal appendages, resembling those generally
present amongst the Lepadidæ, but never found in the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>. The Branchiæ are generally smaller than in the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>; and are sometimes quite rudimentary.</p>

<p>In the introductory description (p. <a href="#Page_152">152</a> and <a href="#Page_176">176</a>) of the
Family <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, I have already discussed the relations of
the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a> to the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, and of the several genera
to each other, so that I need not here re-enter on the subject.</p>

<p class="p2">This, the typical genus, is the largest and widest distributed
group of the sub-family <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>. The founder
of the genus apparently did not perceive its essential
character; Savigny, however, as is evident from the excellent
figure in the great work on Ægypt, perfectly understood<a name="Page_448" id="Page_448" href="#Page_448"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 448]</span></a>
the difference between <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> and <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>. I was

<p>The shell, owing apparently to its containing much animal
matter, is particularly subject to disintegration; and when
thus much affected it is quite impossible to distinguish the
species by external characters. It is, in fact, best to cast
on one side external appearance, though when the shells
happen to be well preserved, each species has its own peculiar
aspect. We have in this genus smooth and plicated,
cylindrical and depressed varieties of most of the species.
The development of the radii is very apt to vary, and even
the compartments often become so completely united and
calcified together that the sutures are almost or quite obliterated.
A more serious difficulty in discriminating the
species, arises from the fact of the opercular valves, not only
varying extremely in external appearance in consequence of
the greater or less disintegration of their apices, and consequent
exposure of their articular ridges and furrows (compare
fig. <a href="#p18f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p18f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p18f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>, in Pl. <a href="#Page_702">18</a>), but from their truly varying
in outline with the varying shape of the shell: this latter
circumstance is probably due to the opercular membrane
which unites the valves to the shell being very narrow, and
in consequence, differences in the shape of the shell affect
the opercular valves, in a manner and to a degree to which
the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> are not subject (compare fig. <a href="#p18f01e">1 <i>e</i></a>, <a href="#p18f01f">1 <i>f</i></a>, <a href="#p18f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>, in
Pl. <a href="#Page_702">18</a>). The scuta, on the other hand, differ to an unusually
slight degree in the different species. In the common
<a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>, which abounds on the southern
British shores, the whole external aspect of the shell is<a name="Page_449" id="Page_449" href="#Page_449"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 449]</span></a>
often so completely masked, owing to its varying shape,
its obliterated sutures, its deeply disintegrated and punctured
surface, and by the corroded condition of its opercular
valves, that I have found this species, in the collections of
naturalists who have attended to cirripedes, arranged actually
on the same tablet, mingled with specimens of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus
balanoides</i></a>. I have myself several times found it less
troublesome to discriminate these two genera by the included
animal's body than by the shell,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[131]</span></a> though the latter,
when well preserved and developed, possesses such obviously
well-marked characters: the same thing has occurred
to me with some of the other species.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_131_131" id="Footnote_131_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_131_131"><span class="label">[131]</span></a> It will be found ultimately to save time and trouble, to soak for half an
hour in hot caustic potash, a specimen out of each group of shells to be
examined, and then well wash and brush the separated valves and compartments;
this process has been followed by me with all the species here to be
described.</p></div>

<p><i>General Appearance.</i>—The shell is generally depressed,
but sometimes, when growing in groups, cylindrical. The
surface is either smooth or longitudinally folded; and, as
already stated, very apt to be deeply disintegrated. The
radii, when developed, are narrow, with their summits
oblique and rounded; but they are often quite absent, and
sometimes even the sutures are almost obliterated. The
rostrum and carina are of the same shape and size, and the
two lateral compartments on each side are of nearly equal
breadths. The orifice is generally sub-rhomboidal, being
widest towards the carinal, instead of towards the rostral
end, as is usual in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>: but in <a href="#Chthamalus_fissus"><i>Chthamalus fissus</i></a> the
orifice is narrow and elongated. The opercular valves have
their apices generally disintegrated and worn away, and are
then seen to be deeply locked together. The colour of the
shell is dirty white or dull purplish-red or brown; but in
<a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a> rich violet-purple. The species are small, not
often exceeding half an inch in basal diameter, with the
exception of <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>C. Hembeli</i></a>, of which I have seen a specimen
two and three quarters of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—These present no particular character, excepting
in most cases the large development of the articular ridge,
and sometimes the presence of a furrow above the articular<a name="Page_450" id="Page_450" href="#Page_450"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 450]</span></a>
ridge, of which only traces can rarely be detected in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>;
hence in these cases, as in <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>C. Hembeli</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_702">18</a>, fig. <a href="#p18f05a">5 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p18f05c">5 <i>c</i></a>)
and <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>scabrosus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_703">19</a>, fig. <a href="#p19f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p19f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>), the line of articulation
between the scutum and tergum is more complicated than
is usual. There is generally a slight pit, sometimes even
furnished with small crests, for the lateral scutal depressor
muscle: in <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>C. scabrosus</i></a> (fig. <a href="#p19f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>, <i>q</i>) a part of this muscle is
attached to a small pit at the basi-scutal corner of the tergum,—a
fact of which I have observed no instance in any other
genus. In <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a> the terga and scuta are calcified
together, without even a suture being visible on their
internal faces. In <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>C. Hembeli</i></a> the valve is externally marked
by a few longitudinal furrows.</p>

<p>The <i>Terga</i>, like the scuta, have a prominent articular
ridge and deep furrow. In many specimens of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>
and in <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>C. scabrosus</i></a> the valve is narrow: in <a href="#Chthamalus_fissus"><i>C. fissus</i></a> it is
triangular and nearly equilateral. The crests for the depressores
muscles are well developed: in <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>C. scabrosus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_703">19</a>,
fig. <a href="#p19f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>, <i>p</i>) these crests are united into a plate, which, together
with the outer lamina of the valve, forms a deep narrow pit:
in <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>C. Hembeli</i></a> the crests are furnished with small sub-crests.
The opercular membrane is narrow; it is sometimes furnished
with a few minute spines.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Parietes.</i>—The parietes are solid, and
composed of successive layers of shell; the inner surface
varies in condition in the same species, being either smooth
or marked with branching impressed lines, or mamillated,
or often irregularly punctured for the entrance of tubuli.
Owing to these tubuli, the walls, when externally disintegrated,
often become punctured. In certain depressed
varieties of both <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>scabrosus</i></a> the walls are supported
by irregular depending columns, placed along either
one side or both sides of the sutures. In <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a> we
have the remarkable character of the wall of the shell growing
(I presume after a certain age) almost rectangularly inwards,
thus forming a rather wide, flat, calcareous rim round
the central basal membrane. In <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>C. Hembeli</i></a> the internal basal
edges of the parietes, in one moderately young specimen,
were rugged with irregular points, but presented no other
remarkable appearance; but in five old and very large spe<a name="Page_451" id="Page_451" href="#Page_451"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 451]</span></a>cimens,
the whole basis was calcareous, being absolutely
continuous with the inner lamina of the parietes, showing
that the latter had grown flatly inwards all round, and
had then become confluent in the middle, so that there was
no longer any basal membrane; excepting, no doubt, that
which had existed in the younger stage, and which would
be preserved in a functionless condition between the surface
of attachment and the inflected parietes.</p>

<p>When an opercular valve or compartment is dissolved in
acid, layers of tissue are left, and these are seen to be penetrated
by tubuli, which enter at the punctures before
mentioned on the inside of the shell: these tubuli often
stand in groups of three or four together; they are about
1/10000th of an inch in diameter. Besides these irregularly
scattered tubuli, there are in the opercular valves of <a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>C.
antennatus</i></a>, innumerable smaller parallel tubuli, running
to the external investing membrane.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Radii and Alæ.</i>—The radii, when developed,
are always rather narrow. Their recipient furrows
are generally nearly as broad as the radii themselves. Their
edges are either quite smooth, as in <a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>C. antennatus</i></a>; or very
finely crenated; or, as in <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>C. dentatus</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>Hembeli</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_702">18</a>,
fig. <a href="#p18f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p18f05a">5 <i>a</i></a>), so strongly crenated as to make the suture,
both externally and internally, toothed: in these two species,
the radii are ribbed in transverse lines parallel to the basis,
each rib corresponding with one of the projecting and interlocking
teeth on the sutures. In <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a>, and
much less plainly in most specimens of <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>C. scabrosus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_703">19</a>,
fig. <a href="#p19f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p19f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>), we have a structure in appearance very different,
for the radii here consist of several very oblique plates, (<i>i. e.</i>
nearly parallel to the parietes) on both sides of the sutures,
which are interfolded or locked together: I believe that this
structure is a mere modification of that in <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>C. dentatus</i></a> and
<a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>Hembeli</i></a>, the transverse ridges on the radii of those species
being here developed into oblique plates. We shall hereafter
meet with a similar structure in the genus <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>; to which
genus, until meeting with these two species of <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>,
I had thought that the interfolding sutures had been confined.
The alæ have their edges generally finely crenated: during
diametric growth (when such takes place), they are rarely<a name="Page_452" id="Page_452" href="#Page_452"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 452]</span></a>
added to above the level of the opercular membrane, and
hence their summits are oblique: in <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a>, however,
the alæ are laterally added to above the opercular membrane,
and their recipient furrows are likewise added to, of
which fact I have seen no other distinct instance in any
genus; hence on both sides of the sutures, in the sheath of
this species, the lines of growth are upturned. In some
much disintegrated specimens, both of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a> (var.
<i>depressus</i>) and of <a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>C. antennatus</i></a>, the radii have been corroded
away, and the diametric growth is effected exclusively by
the growth of the alæ, which are moreover much exposed,
and rendered conspicuous. The sheath descends a moderate
distance down the shell. When a shell is boiled in
potash, the sutures (excepting when abnormally calcified
together, as very often happens with some species) always
fall apart, showing that the union is simply by animalised matter.</p>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—The basis is always membranous; but we have
seen, in <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a>, that the walls form a flat ledge all
round the base, and that in <i>old</i> specimens of <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>C. Hembeli</i></a>, they
grow so far inwards and become so completely confluent, that
they might most easily be mistaken for a true calcareous basis.
I may add, that in one elongated specimen of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>
from La Plata, the walls had likewise grown rectangularly inwards,
forming a flat base, and had then turned upwards in
the middle, forming a medial crest, with the edges not
quite calcified together. The true basal membrane is
very obscurely divided into concentric slips. I observed
in several species, attached to the lower surface, an excessively
fine network, quadrangular or hexagonal, of
yellow vessels, which seemed insensibly to pass into the
sheets, discs, and globules of cement, by which the membranous
basis adheres to the supporting surface. I saw, in
<a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>C. antennatus</i></a>, numerous irregular, bifurcating, and inosculating
cement-ducts, of unequal diameter, often crossing
each other, and sending off branches ending in points: the
older ducts, instead of being solidly filled up with cement,
were only divided by septa. I did not succeed, in any
species, in discovering the cement-glands.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The <i>labrum</i> is slightly bullate, with the middle
portion depressed, but not forming a notch; in some species<a name="Page_453" id="Page_453" href="#Page_453"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 453]</span></a>
it is hairy, and in some pectinated with short spines. The
<i>palpi</i> are of moderate size. The mandibles have from three
to five main teeth, the number sometimes varying even in
the same species: the lower teeth are either plainly double
laterally, or very obscurely double, or to all appearance quite
single: a rather large lower portion of the mandible is finely
pectinated. The maxillæ are always notched under the two
or three large upper spines: the notch bears some fine
spines: beneath the notch there are some large spines, and
at the inferior angle some smaller ones.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The first and second pairs are always very short
compared with the four posterior pairs. The rami of the
first pair are slightly unequal. The third pair, in length
and arrangement of the spines, very closely resembles the
three posterior pairs; in <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a>, however, the few
basal segments, chiefly on the anterior ramus, are thickly
clothed with bristles, like the segments of the second cirrus.
In <a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>C. antennatus</i></a> (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f02">2</a>), the anterior ramus of
this same third pair is usually (one single specimen being
excepted) much elongated, having at least twice as many
segments as the posterior ramus, but the number is variable;
and these segments, either all, or only the upper
ones, instead of having their spines regularly arranged in
pairs, in a double row, are surmounted each by a circle of
spines: I suspect that these elongated rami of the third
cirrus act as antennæ. It can hardly be an accidental coincidence,
that certain genera, as Lysmata and Pandalus,
amongst the Macrourous Crustaceans, have the same leg
(homologically the second thoracic limb) elongated and
antenniformed. Certain varieties of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_cirratus"><i>cirratus</i></a>,
also, have the anterior ramus of this same third cirrus considerably
elongated. We are thus reminded of the remarkable
variability in the numbers of the segments, and in the
arrangement of their spines, in the cirri of <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a>;
in that species, however, it was chiefly the terminal segments
of the <i>posterior</i> ramus of the third cirrus which were
so highly variable. The three posterior pairs of cirri in
<a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> support from three to five pairs of main spines
on each segment, the number often varying in the same
species, with some minute intermediate bristles. The<a name="Page_454" id="Page_454" href="#Page_454"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 454]</span></a>
dorsal surfaces of these segments, in some of the species,
are serrated in an upward direction.</p>

<p><i>Body, &amp;c.</i>—The body does not present any particular
character: in <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>C. scabrosus</i></a> there is a slight ridge running
from the base of the first cirrus towards the adductor
scutorum muscle: this ridge is clothed with a few hairs;
there are also some hairs at the carinal end of the sack. In
<a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>C. dentatus</i></a>, also, there are hairs on the outer tunic of the
prosoma. In two species which I opened, there were no
cæca to the stomach. The ova vary in length from
13 to 14/2000th of an inch in length; they are packed in two lamellæ
lying on each side of the animal's body. The larva just
escaped out of the egg, in <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>, <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>scabrosus</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>dentatus</i></a>,
had a large probosciformed mouth.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ.</i>—These present a very singular amount of
difference within the limits of the same genus. In
<a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>antennatus</i></a> we have a simple fillet, tapering
a little, barely plicated, and about half, or more than half,
as long as the sack; in <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>C. scabrosus</i></a> the branchiæ are entirely
aborted, or are perhaps represented by the slight hairy ridge
at the carinal end of the sack: in <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>C. dentatus</i></a>, on the other
hand, each branchia consists of two large folds, barely
plicated, almost covering the whole side of the sack, so that
here the branchiæ are developed to an unusual degree,
more than in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, and as in <a href="#Genus_Coronula">Coronula</a> and its allies: in
the same manner as in these latter genera, the outer fold is
considerably larger than the inner fold.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—<a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a> is the most distinct species
of the genus, as shown by the peculiar radii and alæ, by
the scuta and terga being calcified together, by the character
of the third pair of cirri, and by the inflected parietes
forming a ledge round the membranous basis; but in this
latter respect <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a> resembles <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>C. Hembeli</i></a>. <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>C. Hembeli</i></a>,
in its serrated radii, is closely related to <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>C. dentatus</i></a>; and
this latter species differs in the structure of its radii only
in degree from certain varieties of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>. Lastly,
<a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a>, in its peculiar radii, closely resembles <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>C.
scabrosus</i></a>, and this latter species does not differ much from
the other species. Hence the genus <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> has no
claims to be subdivided into smaller genera.</p>

<p><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455" href="#Page_455"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 455]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Range.</i>—The species are found all round the world, from
(as far as I have seen) 54°-55° north, to Cape Horn, in
55°-56° south. All the species, of the habits of which I
know anything, are littoral; and in many parts of the world
are excessively numerous, quite covering large spaces of the
coast-rocks, and often coating the coast-shells. <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>Chthamalus
dentatus</i></a> is littoral, like the other species; but it often lives
attached on <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>Balanus tintinnabulum</i></a> and <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>amphitrite</i></a>, on
the bottoms of ships arriving in British ports from the
west coast of Africa. I do not know of any instance of
more than two species occurring in the same region. Some
of the species have large ranges: <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>C. scabrosus</i></a> extends from
the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego to Peru; and
<a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a> has an enormous extension over almost the
whole world, excepting the west coast of South America and
Australia. I do not believe any species of the genus, owing
probably to their littoral habits, have hitherto been found
fossil.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">This species is very widely distributed and extremely
common. On the coast-rocks of the southern shores of
England it is, in parts, even more numerous than the
<a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>Balanus balanoides</i></a>, with which it often grows mingled.
As already stated, it is often confounded in British collections
with this species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, under the name of
<i>Balanus punctatus</i>; that Montagu had this <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a> in
view, when describing his <i>Lepas punctatus</i>, is certain, from
his original specimen in the British Museum, but whether
this was the case with his predecessor, Pulteney, in the
Dorset Catalogue, I do not feel so sure. <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus
stellatus</i></a> varies, as we shall immediately see, extremely in
appearance. Some of the varieties, as <i>var. depressus</i>, which
in external aspect are especially distinct, I have no doubt
are really varieties, but whether this is the case with some
of the forms from the more distant localities, is a little more
doubtful; but I beg that it may be observed, that I have,
in the case of every one of the varieties, and of all the
specimens from distant localities, cleaned with potash and
most carefully examined the disarticulated valves, and likewise
dissected the included animal's body.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—British specimens are usually conical, and
have their walls folded, corroded in their upper parts, with the radii
not developed, and the sutures more or less obliterated; in this state
the orifice of the shell is entire, and very broadly oval: I have seen
specimens in this condition from Madeira, Brazil, and the Gulf of<a name="Page_457" id="Page_457" href="#Page_457"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 457]</span></a>
Corea. The shells when crowded, are rendered cylindrical, and
more or less elongated, with the sutures as viewed externally quite
obliterated; the surface rugged and much disintegrated; and the orifice
nearly circular: in this extreme condition I have seen specimens from
England, from near Genoa, and from the mouth of the Plata: the
specimens from these last two localities were of remarkable size, being
half an inch in diameter, and rather more than half an inch in height.
Again, other British specimens (fig. <a href="#p18f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>), though not nearly so common, are
rather steeply conical, and have not only their sutures distinct, but narrow
radii are plainly developed on apparently both sides of the sutures; in this
case the orifice is slightly toothed, and is rather elongated: I have seen
specimens in this condition, but with their walls rather more deeply
folded, from the Cape de Verde and Philippine Archipelago. Other
specimens, from some unknown tropical sea, differed only in the walls
being but slightly folded, and being so perfectly preserved as to be
externally covered with membrane: this latter circumstance gave the
specimens a peculiar appearance. In this condition were some specimens
(fig. <a href="#p18f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>) attached to oysters sent to me by Professor Agassiz, from
Charlestown; and which differed from all the others that I have seen, in
the thinness and smoothness of their compartments, and in the facility
with which the compartments separated from each other and from the surface
of attachment: hence I have called this form, which, until finding
more important differences, I must rank as a variety, <i>fragilis</i>: it has
stronger claims than the other varieties to be specifically separated;
but I suspect that it has been exposed to some peculiar modifying
conditions.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have the variety (fig. <a href="#p18f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>) excellently figured and described
by Poli, under the name of <i>L. depressa</i>: this is much depressed, with the
walls thin, not folded, with the surface much corroded, with the sutures
very distinct, with the radii not at all or barely developed, but with
the alæ largely developed, and marked with lines of growth, resulting
from the diametric growth of the shell: the orifice is hexagonal, but
broadest towards the carinal end: most of the specimens, <em>but not all</em>,
have on the under sides of their compartments rugged pillars depending
from beneath the alæ, for the purpose, apparently, of supporting
the much depressed shell. This much depressed variety attains a
larger basal diameter (but not a greater bulk or internal capacity)
than any other variety, namely, sometimes three quarters of an inch.
The great peculiarities of this variety result, apparently, from its much
depressed form, deeply corroded not folded walls, and considerable
diametric growth; from the latter cause the alæ are largely developed;
as I can find neither internally nor externally any fixed diagnostic
character I have not hesitated to rank this form as a variety. Poli
found his specimens mingled with the ordinary <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>, on the
shores of Sicily; and I collected at St. Jago, in the Cape de Verde
Archipelago, some specimens nearly as well characterised, also associated
with the common variety.</p>

<p>The shell itself is dirty-white or gray, or brown: in some varieties,
however, the white is nearly pure: internally the parietes are generally
tinted dull purple. The corium of the sack is dark greenish-black,<a name="Page_458" id="Page_458" href="#Page_458"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 458]</span></a>
with a white edge to the lips lining the aperture between the opercular
valves.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell and Radii, &amp;c.</i>—The under side of the parietes is
either quite smooth, or marked with slight, branching, depressed
lines; or mamillated; or irregularly studded with large pores. I have
already alluded to the pillars, depending from the under sides of the
alæ in most specimens of <i>var. depressus</i>: these pillars tend to form
ridges, parallel to the sides of the compartment, like those we shall
presently see in certain specimens of <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>C. scabrosus</i></a>. The radii are very
narrow, when best developed; their edges, when disarticulated, can be
seen, when examined by a strong lens, to be finely crenated. The
edges of the alæ are likewise very finely crenated.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—The outline of these valves varies considerably in specimens
taken out of the same group: we have either a nearly equilateral triangle
(fig. <a href="#p18f01f">1 <i>f</i></a>) or the tergal margin (<a href="#p18f01e">1 <i>e</i></a>) is much shorter than the other margins.
There is always a deep depression for the adductor muscle, and a small
pit of very variable depth for the lateral depressor. But the tergal
margin offers the greatest variability; here we see a very prominent
articular ridge or fold, having either a straight edge or a single or
double prominence (fig. <a href="#p18f01e">1 <i>e</i></a>-<a href="#p18f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>). In specimens in the same group we
find considerable variation in these points; but the amount of difference
is sometimes so great, that I long hesitated whether to rank some of
the varieties as species. The <i>Terga</i>, likewise, vary greatly in shape
and width: in some of the commonest varieties (and in <i>var. depressus</i>)
the valve is very narrow, with the under surface channelled or concave:
in other varieties the valve is much broader and flatter. The spur is
but slightly developed. The crests for the depressor muscles barely
descend beneath the basal margin of the valve. The articular ridge, in
some varieties (as in specimens from Madeira and the Cape de Verde
Islands), is extremely prominent and straight (<a href="#p18f01f">1 <i>f</i></a>); in others, it is little
prominent and deeply sinuous (<a href="#p18f01h">1 <i>h</i></a>). This great variability in the articular
margins of the scutum and tergum seems to be mainly due to the corrosion
to which these valves have been subjected, and their consequently
modified growth: in some specimens the articular ridge of the scutum,
and in others that of the tergum, has been largely developed, in either
case their mutual outlines being greatly affected.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ.</i>—These are narrow, hardly at all plicated, elongated,
being about half as long as the sack. In a specimen from La Plata,
this organ ended rather more abruptly in a point than it did in other
specimens.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The crest of the labrum is usually hairy, but in a specimen
from Bahia (Brazil) there were some very fine teeth. The palpi vary
somewhat in shape, and sometimes have a row of bristles along their
basal exterior margins. The mandibles usually have four main teeth,
the lowest one being confluent with the inferior pectinated angle: in
<i>var. depressus</i>, in the same individual, there were only three teeth on
one side of the mouth and five on the other; the lower main teeth are
laterally double, but generally one tooth of each pair is so small and
obscure as to be perceived with difficulty. In the maxillæ, there are
some large spines above the notch, and in the notch some fine ones:<a name="Page_459" id="Page_459" href="#Page_459"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 459]</span></a>
in <i>var. depressus</i>, and in a cylindrical <i>var.</i> from La Plata, there was
quite a tuft of small spines above the notch.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The outer surface of the pedicel of the second cirrus bears
a tuft of long, fine, plumose hairs: the terminal segments of the rami
of this cirrus sometimes (as in the La Plata specimens) support a clump
of coarsely pectinated spines. In specimens having six segments in
the shorter ramus of the second cirrus, the shorter ramus of the third
cirrus had fifteen segments. The two rami of the third cirrus are usually
equal in length and in the number of their segments; but in the Brazilian
specimen there were fifteen segments in the posterior, and twenty-six
in the anterior ramus; in another specimen, fixed on a tropical Perna,
there were in the two rami of this third cirrus eighteen and twenty-four
segments. In the three posterior pairs of cirri each segment
carries either four or five pairs of main spines: the segments vary a
little in the degree to which they are elongated, being most elongated
in the var. from La Plata, with an elongated shell.</p>

<p><i>Varieties.</i>—It will have been observed, that the shell, in the specimens
from several distant quarters of the world over which this species,
as I believe, ranges, differs considerably in external aspect: so do the
opercular valves; and so do the parts of the mouth and cirri: but I
cannot make out that these differences are coordinated. Thus, <i>var.
depressus</i>, which is so entirely different from the others in appearance,
differs only internally in the presence of a tuft of fine spines above the
notch of the maxillæ; and this character is found in the La Plata
variety, which, as far as the shell and opercular valves are concerned,
is at the other end of the scale of variation. Again, <i>var. fragilis</i>, from
Charlestown, presents, in the animal's body, hardly any difference. The
Brazilian specimens, which in the shell and operculum offer only quite
common characters, have the remarkable peculiarity of a considerable
difference in the length and number of the segments in the rami of
the third cirrus; they, also, have the segments of the sixth cirrus considerably
elongated, and the labrum finely toothed. Of these peculiarities
one alone, namely, the inequality in the rami of the third cirrus,
but in a lesser degree, is common to the specimens adhering to the
tropical Perna, which had a shell very unlike the Brazilian variety, but
which, on the other hand, differed scarcely in a single character from
some other specimens from an unknown tropical sea, in which the
rami of the third cirrus were quite equal. The La Plata specimens
differ most in internal characters, viz., in the tuft of fine spines above
the notch of the maxillæ, in the coarsely pectinated spines on the tips
of the second pair of cirri, in having the segments of the sixth cirrus
much elongated, and in the apex of the branchiæ being abruptly
pointed; yet in the shell and operculum they were identical with certain
Mediterranean varieties. From these several facts, I must believe
that all the widely distributed forms here grouped together, do really
belong to the same species.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—Shell conical, rather
smooth; when not much corroded, of a pale dirty flesh-colour; often
covered by membrane; sometimes deeply corroded, extremely rugged,
and then of a brown colour; in this condition not much punctured,
as generally is the case with <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>. Sutures almost always quite
distinct; rarely the shell becomes cylindrical with the sutures obliterated.
Orifice moderately elongated, sub-hexagonal. Radii rather
narrow, but not so narrow as in <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>, smooth, with their upper
margins very oblique: when disarticulated their edges are quite smooth.
The edges of the alæ are sometimes crenated, and sometimes not so,
being only marked by lines of growth; they are often rather thick.
The parietes are usually rather thick, with their internal surfaces
smooth, and not mamillated, as is so often the case with <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>.
The largest specimens which I have seen, were .6 of an inch in basal
diameter.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves.</i>—These are hardly distinguishable from those of
<a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>. The only very slight difference which I can point out is,
that the crests for the tergal depressores are less spread out, and depend
rather more beneath the basal margin of the valve; and lastly, that the
surface of the tergum, just above these crests, is rather prominent.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ</i>: these are oblong; taper but little, and have a broad
rounded end: they are scarcely plicated.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The crest of labrum is hairy: the palpi are square, and
have no bristles along their basal exterior margins, but long ones at
their truncated ends. The mandibles have three or four main teeth apparently
single: the inferior coarsely pectinated portion is short. The
maxillæ are deeply notched.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The first and second pairs, and portions of the third, are
darker coloured than the three posterior pairs. The rami in both of
the first two pairs are slightly unequal in length. The third cirrus is
much longer than the second: in a specimen in which there were six
segments in the shorter ramus of the first and second pairs, there were
twenty segments in the posterior and shorter ramus of the third cirrus;
and in this same individual there were no less than forty-nine segments
in the anterior ramus. In another specimen (Pl. <a href="#Page_713">29</a>, fig. <a href="#p29f02">2</a>) the number
of segments in the two rami of the third cirrus, was 20 and 41; in
another, the numbers were 18 and 53; in several other specimens the<a name="Page_461" id="Page_461" href="#Page_461"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 461]</span></a>
numbers varied in about these proportions; but in one single specimen
the numbers were equal. Not only did the number of segments thus
vary in the two rami, but likewise the arrangement of the spines on
the segments in the anterior and longer ramus; in some specimens the
spines on all the segments were arranged in a single circle, and then
the organ had a specially antenniformed appearance: in other specimens,
some of the lower segments (in one case thirteen in number) had
the spines placed in regular pairs precisely as on the posterior ramus,
and as on the three posterior pairs of cirri. Under the genus I have
pointed out the resemblance between this structure and that occurring
in certain Macrourous Crustaceans. The pedicel of the third cirrus
had its spines more crowded and irregular than on the three posterior
pairs of cirri. The segments in the latter vary in bearing either three
or four pairs of main spines. The whole dorsal surfaces of the lower
segments of the several posterior cirri are serrated in an upward
direction by short spines, but to a variable degree.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—Shell dirty white or
gray: sometimes tinted pale purple within; irregularly conical, or much
depressed, or cylindrical and much elongated. Generally much corroded,
sometimes well preserved and covered by membrane. Orifice
rather large, of variable shape. Sutures often quite obliterated.
Radii when developed narrow, with their sutural edges, as well as those
of the alæ, generally very finely crenated, but to a variable degree.
The membrane lining the sheath and covering the opercular valves, is
remarkable from each zone being fimbriated; for this expression is more
correct than to say that the membrane bears a row of spines, though
the fimbriæ do approach in character to spines; sometimes, though
rarely, the fimbriæ are branched. The largest specimens which I have
seen (from Coquimbo and Valparaiso) were half an inch in basal diameter,
and some of these were so much elongated as to be one inch in
height.</p>

<p><i>Scuta.</i>—The scuta are rather narrow: they have a somewhat peculiar
appearance, from the articular furrow being wide, and from the
articular ridge projecting with a uniform curvature: the pit for the
lateral depressor muscle has some minute crests, of which I have seen
traces in the foregoing species. The <i>Terga</i> vary somewhat in shape:<a name="Page_462" id="Page_462" href="#Page_462"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 462]</span></a>
they have the basi-carinal angle of the valve, where the narrow crests
for the depressores are placed, pointed and dependent, and the surface
of the valve above these crests is prominent. Altogether the opercular
valves have a sufficiently distinct character to be recognised without
much difficulty.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The crest of the labrum is not toothed; the palpi have
long hairs along the exterior basal margin. The lower main teeth of
the mandibles are plainly laterally double. <i>Cirri.</i>—The pedicel of the
second cirrus is extremely broad, and on the exterior margin supports
a tuft of very long, finely plumose spines: in some specimens each of
the lower segments of the anterior ramus of this cirrus bore one or two
very large spines, doubly and extremely coarsely pectinated. In two
specimens the rami of the third cirrus were of equal length: but in one
specimen (from Iquique, Peru), having seven segments in the shorter
ramus of the first and second pairs of cirri, the posterior ramus of the third
pair had fourteen segments, and the anterior ramus twenty-two segments.
The posterior cirri have segments carrying five pairs of main
spines: the dorsal surfaces of the lower segments are serrated.</p>

<p><i>General Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—Shell globulo-conical,
irregular, with the walls much folded. Colour brownish. Sutures
generally distinct in young specimens, and nearly obliterated in full-grown
individuals. Radii, when present, very narrow. The orifice of
the shell, in full-grown specimens which have their summits a little
worn, is narrow, much elongated, about twice as long as wide, oval or
ovate, with the rostral end the narrowest: the elongation of the orifice
offers almost the only character by which this species can be externally
recognised. The lateral compartments are rather wider than usual in
proportion to the rostro-lateral compartments. Basal diameter of largest
specimen .2 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, elongated transversely, with the pit for the adductor muscle
bordered on the under side by an adductor ridge rather more prominent

and equably curved from one end to the other.</p>

<p>Neither the <i>Mouth</i> nor <i>Cirri</i> offer any peculiar characters distinct from

toothed, and that the segments of the posterior pairs of cirri support
five pairs of main spines.</p>

<p class="p2">The characters by which this species differs from <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C.

in the triangular and equilateral terga, and in the
much elongated orifice of the shell; and these differences
I believe to be of specific value. I must, however, confess
that I have examined one young specimen attached to a
<i>Pollicipes elegans</i>, in which the orifice was not nearly so
much elongated, and in which the terga were not so equilateral,
with the basal margin not quite equably curved,
but more protuberant on the scutal than on the carinal
side: from an examination, however, of only one specimen,
and that a young one, I cannot decide on its specific
nature.</p>

brown, or gray: conical, moderately depressed: walls either broadly and
irregularly folded (fig. <a href="#p18f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>), with the surface corroded, or (when attached
to ships' bottoms and sometimes to other Cirripedes) narrowly and regularly
folded (<a href="#p18f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>), with the surface well preserved, smooth, and generally
covered by thin brown membrane. These latter specimens generally
have the shell more steeply conical, with the orifice rather smaller, and
the radii broader, than in the first-mentioned specimens, which are
attached to coast-rocks and shells, and have had their summits worn
down. The sutures in all cases are tolerably distinct, and have their
edges toothed and interlocked: the crenations are visible before the
compartments are disarticulated, when viewed either internally or externally,
but occasionally they are obscure. The radii, when best
developed, are rather narrow, and of equal width on both sides of the
sutures, with their summits rounded: their surfaces are finely ribbed
transversely, each rib corresponding with, or rather forming a point
of, the toothed edge. On the under side these teeth usually are a little<a name="Page_464" id="Page_464" href="#Page_464"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 464]</span></a>
hollow or are pitted: the radii, in fact, may be said to be folded, like
the parietes, only more symmetrically and narrowly, so that the points
in the opposed edges interlock. The edges of alæ are serrated, but
more finely than the radii. The parietes are rather thin, with their
under surfaces generally smooth. The sheath does not descend far
down the shell. The colour of the corium lining the sack and the
animal's body varies considerably, being either almost black or pale
purple; and the specimens adhering to ships' bottoms are internally
almost white. Of these latter specimens, I have seen some .6 of an
inch in basal diameter: of corroded specimens attached to littoral
shells, I have not seen one quite .4 of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, with the articular ridge very prominent: the pit for the
adductor is deep, and there are generally some distinct, though
minute, pits for the lateral depressores. The <i>Terga</i> (fig. <a href="#p18f03c">3 <i>c</i></a>) have the
articular ridge very prominent; and the carinal margin is rather more
arched and protuberant than in the other species.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The crest of the <i>labrum</i> is toothed: the palpi are short,
truncated, with long spines arising from their ends, and along the
basal exterior margin. In the mandibles the first tooth is seated rather
far from the succeeding teeth: the inferior part is coarsely pectinated:
the maxillæ are deeply notched. The tips of second pair of <i>Cirri</i> have
many coarsely pectinated spines: the shorter ramus had six segments,
whilst the shorter ramus of the third pair had eighteen segments: the
segments on the posterior cirri carry five pairs of main spines.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ, &amp;c.</i>—These consist of a double fold, the outer one being the
largest, and the inner semi-circular, as has been described under the
genus. In a young specimen, only one tenth of an inch in basal diameter,
the branchiæ consisted of a single fold; in a specimen a little larger,
there were two folds, but these were of equal size: ultimately the outer
fold increases in size so as to become nearly double the inner fold.
The <i>Ovarian tubes</i> are remarkable from their large diameter. I was
surprised to observe in the specimen only one tenth of an inch in basal
diameter, that the larvæ were ready to escape. On the prosoma, there
are some longish <i>hairs</i> arranged in short rows, and some few on the
membrane lining the sack, and some on the opercular membrane and
valves.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">It may be seen in Pl. <a href="#Page_702">18</a>, fig. <a href="#p18f03a">3 <i>a</i></a>, and <a href="#p18f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>, that I have
here united two varieties considerably different in external
aspect: I have done this without hesitation, inasmuch as
there are intermediate forms, and as the differences are
analogous with those so commonly occurring in sessile cirripedes;
dependent on whether or not the specimens have
been exposed to corrosion. I have seen both varieties from
Natal, and both from the west coast of Africa; although the
smooth, well-preserved, narrowly plicated varieties seem
more common in western than in southern Africa. With
respect to the range of the species, I have seen a specimen<a name="Page_465" id="Page_465" href="#Page_465"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 465]</span></a>
from the West Indies, but it was the variety which so commonly
adheres to ships' bottoms. This variety often arrives
alive in British ports; and I have seen a specimen picked
up dead on the beach near Dublin.</p>

<p class="p2">I have seen five, old, large specimens, from an unknown
locality, with their whole surfaces deeply corroded, and
with most of the sutures obliterated; and three separated
valves of a young specimen. From these materials, imperfect
as they are, I feel no hesitation in identifying this
species with the <i>Euraphia Hembeli</i> of Conrad, which is remarkable
in several respects, and especially from being
gigantic in size, compared to other members of its sub-family.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—The young specimen
(fig. <a href="#p18f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>, about .7 of an inch in basal diameter) consists only of the
carina, and the two lateral compartments; but these, as far as I can
judge, resemble the specimen figured and described by Conrad, which
was two inches in diameter. Shell depressed, spreading, surface moderately
smooth, covered by brownish membrane: shell itself pale dull
reddish-purple. The radii are not very narrow, with their summits
rounded and very oblique: their edges are toothed, and their external
surfaces are transversely ribbed, in correspondence with the interlocking
points of the sutures. On the internal surface, the toothed suture is
not visible, except near the base of the shell, owing to the overlapping
of the alæ. The alæ have oblique summits, which are slightly notched
owing to the upturned prominent lines of growth. The parietes are
thick; their basal internal surfaces are rugged, with slightly branching
ridges.</p>

<p>The old specimens (fig. <a href="#p18f05a">5 <i>a</i></a>) are so much corroded that not a particle of<a name="Page_466" id="Page_466" href="#Page_466"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 466]</span></a>
the external surface is left: one of them which was 2-3/4 of an inch in basal
diameter. Shell much depressed, spreading; colour pale purple; orifice
large, rhomboidal, with a slight hollow on each side for the corners
of the scuta: sutures generally in part or wholly obliterated; where
still preserved, the interlocking toothed structure is distinct; the
sheath is strongly marked by lines of growth, and is of a dark
brown colour. The carina and rostrum are of unusually large size
compared with the lateral compartments; and this, as far as I can
judge, must have been the case with the younger specimens. That
portion of the rostro-lateral compartment which forms part of the
sheath, is reduced to a mere ridge. The most remarkable character is,
that all these old specimens (of which the smallest measured nearly
one inch and a half in diameter) had a flat, wide, calcareous basis, which
is absolutely continuous with the inner lamina of the parietes, whereas
in the younger specimen there was no appearance of any tendency in
the parietes thus to grow inflected. There can be hardly any
doubt that in a series of specimens some would be found with the
parietes first forming a flat narrow ledge round the true basal membrane
(as in the following species); and that in others, this ledge
would be wider and wider, till its edges met in the middle, and coalesced
into a continuous plate.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves.</i>—I have seen these only in the old corroded
specimens (fig. <a href="#p18f05c">5 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p18f05d">5 <i>d</i></a>): they are locked together by remarkably
strong articular ridges and furrows.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> have externally two or three impressed lines or narrow
furrows, proceeding from the apex to the middle of the basal margin;
these can be seen only in one of my specimens, owing to the degree to
which the valves have suffered disintegration; but they are mentioned
by Conrad. The basal margin is rather short compared with the other
two margins. The tergal margin is remarkable from the depth of the
upper furrow above the articular ridge, and from the size of the prominence
(appearing like the true apex of the valve) above this upper
furrow. There is a hollow for the adductor muscle, and traces of
crests for both the rostral and lateral depressores. The <i>Terga</i> are
generally but little corroded, and hence the dark brown membrane with
which they are covered is well preserved; the shelly matter itself is
also brown: there is only a trace of this colour in the more corroded
scuta: the external surface of the terga is very smooth. The spur is
pretty well developed, and is half as wide as the whole valve. The
lines of growth are upturned along the carinal margin. The articular
ridges and furrows are much developed. The crests for the depressor
muscles are extremely strong; they depend beneath the basal margin,
and are remarkable (fig. <a href="#p18f05c">5 <i>c</i></a>) from being furnished each with fine sub-crests.</p>

the radii do not differ much from those in <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>C. dentatus</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>Hembeli</i></a>;
we have but to produce obliquely upwards the transverse and interlocking
ribs on their radii, and so convert them into laminæ. During
the diametric growth of the shell, the sutural edges of the alæ are
added to, in the usual manner, by upturned lines of growth; and, in
addition, the recipient furrows of the alæ are similarly added to, so
that the lines of growth are upturned, and alæ appear to have been
developed on both sides of the sutures in the same way as the radii
appear to have been developed on both sides in many <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>,
though rarely in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>. The inside of the shell is beautifully
coloured rich violet; it is punctured with small holes as so often is the
case with <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>. In every specimen (all full-grown) which I
opened, the inner basal edges of the parietes were inflected rectangularly
inwards, forming a smooth-edged ledge all round the basal membrane,
which, in proportion to the width of this ledge, was by so much
reduced in diameter. The largest specimen which I have seen was .35
of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Opercular valves.</i>—The scuta and terga, in all the specimens which
I have seen, were firmly calcified together; in some, a trace of a suture
could be seen externally, but hardly a trace internally. In one specimen,
there were vestiges of some impressed lines on the scutum, in
exactly the same position in which such occur in <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>C. Hembeli</i></a>. The
scutum is rather narrow. The basal margin of the tergum is either
straight, or depends a little on the scutal side, thus producing a small
spur: the crests for the depressor muscles are strongly marked, and
depend beneath the basal margin.</p>

<p><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468" href="#Page_468"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 468]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The labrum is strongly toothed: the palpi have long hairs
along the exterior basal margin: the mandibles have only three main
teeth, and the inferior coarsely pectinated portion is short; the maxillæ
deeply notched. <i>Cirri</i>: the first and second pairs have their
rami slightly unequal in length; the third pair differs from the same pair
in the other species of the genus, in having some few of the basal segments
on the anterior ramus thickly clothed with spines, so as to be
brush-like: there is even a trace of a similar structure in the lowest
segments of the posterior ramus. In the three posterior pairs of cirri
the segments are much elongated, and support four pairs of spines.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ.</i>—Unknown.</p></div>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance and Structure.</i>—Shell generally depressed;
when growing crowded, sometimes cylindrical: colour dingy purplish-brown,
but when much corroded, dirty gray; very young shells are very
dark green, owing to the corium, which is of this colour, being seen
through the valves. Surface generally rugged, from irregular slight
longitudinal folds, and from the transverse overlapping tile-like
lines of growth; but sometimes the surface is nearly smooth, with
very slight longitudinal folds, these being gray coloured, the intermediate
parts being pale dingy purple, the shell thus becoming
striped. Orifice rhomboidal, passing into trigonal, owing to the
great width of the carinal end. Sutures generally very distinct,
rarely obliterated in the cylindrical varieties. Radii narrow,
generally exposing much of the alæ, which are plainly marked by lines
of growth: the radii themselves, when well developed, which is not
often the case, consist of small laminæ or ridges, placed on both sides
of the sutures, and interfolded or interlocked together: usually only a
trace of this structure is exhibited, but occasionally, along some or
along all the sutures (as in the specimen figured), the laminæ of the radii
interfold, as plainly as in <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a>. The alæ differ slightly from
the alæ of the other species, in not forming so much of a rectangular
projection, the lower margin running with a gentle curve into the
parietes. The internal surface of the parietes is either smooth, or
near the basal margin is roughened with depending points: in some<a name="Page_469" id="Page_469" href="#Page_469"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 469]</span></a>
specimens from the Falkland Islands, both edges of each suture were
inflected, forming a double ridge, with roughened edges, resting on the
basal membrane, and supporting the shell. I must mention that in
my notes made at these Islands, I remark that the basal membrane
seemed sometimes to be surrounded by a calcareous rim; none of the
specimens brought home are thus characterised; but bearing in mind
the affinity of this species to <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a>, no doubt we have here
an indication of the shelly ledge surrounding the basis, as described
under that species. The largest specimens which I have seen are a
quarter of an inch in basal diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>Opercular Valves</i> generally have their summits much worn down.
The <i>scuta</i> are elongated in the line of the longer axis of the orifice; the
articular ridge is very prominent, and is placed in the middle of
the tergal margin. The <i>terga</i> are very narrow, as in some varieties of
<a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>C. stellatus</i></a>: they are remarkable in two respects, namely, in the depressor
muscle being attached to a plate, formed apparently by the
union of the usual crests, parallel to the outer lamina of the valve itself,
a deep narrow cavity (fig. <a href="#p19f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>, <i>p</i>) being thus formed; and secondly, in the
far more extraordinary circumstance of the existence of a small pit (<i>q</i>) at
the extreme basi-scutal corner of the valve, in which about half of the
scutal lateral depressor muscle is attached: I have observed no other
instance in any cirripede of the partial attachment of a muscle properly
belonging to one valve to another valve. The figures of the
valves <a href="#p19f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#p19f02c">2 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p19f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>, are from specimens most unusually perfect, with
the upper portion not worn away; the ordinary appearance of the valves
as seen from above, is given in fig. <a href="#p19f02a">2 <i>a</i></a>; at fig. <a href="#p19f02d">2 <i>d</i></a>, a view is given of the
tergum seen from vertically beneath, showing the cavity for its own
depressor muscle, and for part of the lateral depressor muscle of the
scutum.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The crest of the labrum is hairy, without teeth: the palpi
have long spines at the end, but none along the inferior margin: the
mandibles have either four or five graduated teeth, the lower ones of
which are plainly double laterally: the maxillæ have a very sinuous
edge. <i>Cirri</i>: the first and second pairs are very short: on the four
posterior pairs the segments support either four or five pairs of main
spines, with the small intermediate spines rather larger than usual.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ.</i>—None; but where they ought to occur, there are two very
slight ridges clothed with hairs, about the 1/100th of an inch in length.
On the prosoma, there is a slight ridge, extending from the base of
the first cirrus towards the adductor scutorum muscle, also clothed
with hairs; this unusual character of the prosoma being hairy is
common to <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>C. dentatus</i></a>.</p></div>

<p>This species is the commonest cirripede on the shores of
the Falkland Islands: many of the specimens are there
crowded together, and rendered elongated and cylindrical,
with the walls very thin, and the sutures often obliterated;
as the opercular membrane is very narrow, the opercular
valves are much influenced both in their outline and in their<a name="Page_470" id="Page_470" href="#Page_470"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 470]</span></a>
crests and articulations, by the varying form of the shell:
I have even seen specimens with the scutum and tergum
on one side twice as large as on the other side.</p>

<p class="p2">The two species united under this genus agree in
having only four compartments, and in these having a
strong tendency to become confluent; but they resemble
each other hardly in any other respect, more than do
all the species of the present sub-family. <a href="#Chamaesipho_columna"><i>Chamæsipho

genus can hardly be considered a very natural one, though
I could not introduce the two present species into <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>,

<p class="p2">I have identified, with some doubt, the present species
with the <i>Lepas columna</i> of Spengler, obtained from Otaheite,
as no description is given by him of the opercular
valves, and more especially as Spengler's specimens were
an inch in height and seven lines in width, which is much
larger than any of the many specimens seen by me: from
Spengler's clear description of the structure of his shell, it
evidently belongs to the present genus.</p>


<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—The sutures separating
the four compartments are generally, excepting at an early age, quite
obliterated, both internally and externally, the shell in this case consisting
of a single piece, with its summit and opercular valves always
much worn. Occasionally the sutures are preserved, and then the four
compartments are seen to be of nearly equal sizes. The orifice is
always broadly oval, with the carinal end the broadest; and it often
approaches closely to circular. The upper part of the shell is frequently
steeply conical, with the lower part spreading and folded;
sometimes deeply folded. Very young shells are apt to be remarkably
smooth. The radii appear never to be developed: the inside of the
shell is smooth. The colour is either blackish-green (this being the
tint of the corium lining the sack), with the upper part gray from disintegration;
or the lower part is brown, from the investing membrane,
the shell itself being pale coloured. This species seems particularly
liable to grow crowded together; often covering rocks and shells with
a honey-combed layer. The basal diameter of some of the largest
specimens was .3 of a inch. In Mr. Cuming's collection, however,
there is an Australian specimen .55 in diameter and .3 in height,
which is, moreover, remarkable from the projecting, extremely rugged,
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: over-lapping">overlapping</span>, dark-coloured layers of growth, which surround the lower
part of the shell: we have seen that Spengler's specimens, said to have
come from Otaheite, are even broader and considerably higher.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>: from the disintegration which the valves have undergone,
the scuta and terga are externally seen to be locked together by a
deeply sinuous articulation. The <i>Scuta</i> have a wide articular furrow
and a very prominent articular ridge; but the exact outline of these parts
varies greatly, very much as in the genus <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Terga</i> are very narrow, with the under surface channelled: the
attachment of the depressor muscle offers the only peculiarity,—the
muscle being attached to four or five little pits, placed transversely to
the longer axis of the valve; the septa between these little pits
evidently answering to the crests as usually developed.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The crest of the labrum is hairy, and slightly bullate.<a name="Page_472" id="Page_472" href="#Page_472"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 472]</span></a>
The palpi are rather small, with long spines at their ends. The mandibles
have four (sometimes five) teeth, with the inferior portion pectinated.
The maxillæ are notched.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The first pair presents no remarkable character. The second
and third pairs are subject to extreme variation, as in <a href="#Chthamalus_antennatus"><i>Chthamalus
antennatus</i></a> and <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a>. In all the specimens, the anterior
ramus of the second cirrus is short, with all the segments thickly
covered with bristles; it is the posterior ramus which varies so much in
relative length and in the arrangement of the bristles; but in no case
are all the segments clothed with bristles as on the anterior ramus,
and as is normally the case with all sessile cirripedes. In some specimens
from New Zealand, the anterior ramus having only five segments,
the posterior ramus was twice as long, having sixteen segments, with
the bristles arranged in circles, but standing rather thicker together on
the basal segments. In a Tasmanian specimen, the posterior ramus
was only a little longer than the anterior ramus, and the spines were
arranged in regular pairs (as on the three posterior pairs of cirri) on all
the segments, excepting the few basal ones, on which they were more
crowded: a nearly similar arrangement occurred in some other specimens
from unknown localities, excepting that the rami were of nearly
equal length. In the third cirrus, in all the specimens, the anterior
ramus has three or four of its basal segments much broader than
the upper segments, and thickly clothed with spines (as is the case
with one species of <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, viz. <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a>) all the other
segments having regular pairs of spines. The posterior ramus of the
third cirrus varies in being either much longer than, or only equal in
length to, the anterior ramus; in the former case (in the New Zealand
specimen) the spines were arranged in circles, giving an antenniformed
structure to the ramus; and in the latter case they were
arranged in regular pairs. In Mr. Cuming's great Australian specimen,
there was a further peculiarity, in the presence on the posterior cirri of
a tuft of intermediate spines between the main pairs; and, in there being
on those segments, which are thickly covered with spines, certain very
large spines, doubly pectinated, with the pectinations elbowed,
closely like the spines met with on the cirri in certain species of Pollicipes.
Finally, the segments in the three posterior pairs of cirri support
five or six pairs of main spines; the dorsal surfaces of the segment
are rough and hairy.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ</i>, rudimentary; consisting of a small, simple, tongue-formed
fold, projecting about 1/100th of an inch. Ova, 16/2000ths of an
inch in length.</p></div>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—This very singular shell would not, without
some examination, be thought to be a cirripede. From the symmetrical
position of the four apertures, with the diamond-shaped orifice in the
middle, with the sutures on each side of the rostrum, and from its
depressed and circular form, this shell bears some resemblance to the
perforated species of Scutella. Shell much depressed, generally nearly
circular, with the basal margin highly sinuous and even sometimes almost
branched. Surface slightly irregular, marked by fine lines of growth,
and covered by brown membrane. Of the four compartments, the
<i>Rostrum</i> is very narrow, triangular, and comes up to the orifice almost
in a point: it is rather depressed, that is, it lies rather below the level
of the other compartments: the straight sutures separating it from the
lateral compartments are distinct in the upper part, though always obliterated
in old shells in the lower part: these sutures are generally
far plainer than those separating the lateral compartment from the
carina, which in most cases are obliterated and calcified together, excepting
close to the orifice. The alæ of the rostrum are not externally
visible, and there are no radii to any of the compartments. The
<i>Carina</i> is twice as broad as the rostrum, and is furnished with alæ of
the usual shape, which are, to a certain extent, externally visible.
The <i>Lateral Compartments</i> are broad, being broader than the carina;
they are both penetrated, down to the surface of attachment, by a hole
or rather tube,—the two holes standing opposite the rostral end of the
operculum: the carina is penetrated by two rather smaller but similar holes.
It is these four holes which give to this cirripede its very singular
aspect: they are rather smaller than the orifice of the shell; they are
oval, with their longer axes placed in the direction of the ray of the
circular shell: their manner of formation will be immediately explained.
The orifice is neatly diamond-shaped and broad: it is rather small
compared with the whole shell, and is closed by the operculum, which
is seated near the summit of the shell. Basal diameter of largest
specimen 2/10 of an inch; few, however, attained this size, and perfect
larvæ were included in much smaller specimens.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell.</i>—The rostrum (fig. <a href="#p19f04c">4 <i>c</i></a>) is remarkable from its small
size, and from the plainness of its sutures, in comparison with those separating
the other compartments, and this is exactly the reverse of what I
should have expected in a compartment tending to become rudimentary.
Not only is the rostrum small, but the alæ project to an unusually small
degree, and gradually slope away into the lower part of the parietes.
These peculiarities are even more strongly marked in very young shells:
thus in one of the size of a pin's head, the rostrum consisted of a minute
parallelogram, without, as far as I could see, any alæ, and was only
one fourth of the size of the carina,—this latter compartment being
only half as wide as the lateral compartments. The carina, at this early
period, had quite distinct alæ.</p>

<p>The tubular prolongations from the four external holes are of course
very conspicuous on the under side of the shell (<a href="#p19f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>); and their struc<a name="Page_474" id="Page_474" href="#Page_474"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 474]</span></a>ture
is there plainly seen. In extremely young shells the holes are not
present; but very soon, at four points of the circumference, namely,
two in the carina and one in each lateral compartment, the basal edge
becomes indented, and during growth more and more deeply indented;
at last the horns or points of the bays, thus formed in the circumference
of the shell, grow inwards and meet, the four indentations being thus converted
into four rings or holes; as the shell is added to, at its circumference,
these come to stand further and further from the exterior margin;
and as the shell at the same time rises above the surface of attachment,
the holes are added to at their basal edges, and are thus converted into
shelly tubes, generally freely open at the bottom as well as at the top.
Sometimes these tubes are closed at the bottom, and this is usually
caused by their sides having been added to in a spiral direction. A somewhat
sinuous double ridge or fissure, leading from the tubes or holes to the
exterior border, can always be perceived on the under side of the shell.
Occasionally, though rarely, in very old shells, a second series of holes
is formed outside the first four holes, and often a tendency to this
may be perceived in the just-mentioned fissures expanding a
little at their outer ends, thus forming four new circumferential
indentations. The purpose of this peculiar structure, apparently, is to
give support to the much depressed and thin shell. In <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus
stellatus</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_scabrosus"><i>scabrosus</i></a>, we have seen a slight indication of a similar
structure, in the formation on the under side of the shell, but confined
to the lines of sutures, of obscurely tubular pillars: we have
also something analogous in the singular midribs, in <a href="#Genus_Platylepas">Platylepas</a>,
causing the membranous basis to be convex. I need only further
add, that the parietes, in <a href="#Genus_Chamaesipho">Chamæsipho</a>, are rather thin, and are composed
of translucent shell, punctured for the entrance of tubuli, with
the punctures often arranged in straight lines.</p>

<p><i>Opercular Valves</i> (fig. <a href="#p19f04d">4 <i>d</i></a>).—These are attached by a narrow opercular
membrane to the sheath, but little beneath the summit of the shell.
The <i>Scuta</i> are considerably arched or convex: the articular ridge is
very prominent, and there is a thick strong adductor ridge. The <i>Terga</i>
have a short, rather broad, rounded spur, placed very nearly in the
middle of the valve: the crests for the tergal depressores are moderately
developed, and are simple.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The crest of the labrum is hairy, and is much hollowed
out. The palpi are small and narrow, with long bristles at their
apices. The mandibles have four or five teeth, with the lower part
pectinated. The maxillæ are notched. Of the <i>Cirri</i>, the second pair
is short, and all the segments are thickly clothed with bristles. The
third pair in the arrangement of the bristles resembles the four posterior
pairs. The segments in these pairs are elongated, and support
four pairs of main spines.</p>

<p class="p2">The two species here included form a very natural genus,
though, as far as the shell alone is concerned, at first sight
there is an unusual amount of difference between them.
This genus offers an instance of a case, far from uncommon
in nature, though so unfortunate for the systematist, in which
the most obvious and useful characters of a group are completely
masked. When I first examined <a href="#Pachylasma_giganteum"><i>Pachylasma giganteum</i></a>,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[134]</span></a>
I did not doubt that it was a <i><a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a></i>; and when I first
looked at <a href="#Pachylasma_aurantiacum"><i>P. aurantiacum</i></a>, I thought, from there being in
appearance only four compartments, that it was an <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a>;
in neither case, from the absence of alæ to the
rostrum, did I even suspect that the species belonged to the
sub-family of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>. But when I examined the
included animal's body, I found, in both species, the labrum
bullate, not notched, with the palpi small, and the mandibles
with their lower teeth not laterally double. Again I found
in the third pair of cirri only the basal segments thickly
clothed with spines; and lastly, there were caudal appendages.
Now these characters are pre-eminently those of
the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>; in fact, they are those met with in the
typical genus <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>, with the exception of the presence
of caudal appendages, and these <span class="correction" title="In the original book: occur Catophragmus">occur in </span><a href="#Genus_Catophragmus"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: occur Catophragmus">Catophragmus</span></a>,—a
genus standing next to <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>, and in no other genus
of sessile cirripedes. Moreover, if we look to the shell of
<a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, the absence of pores in the parietes, or at least<a name="Page_476" id="Page_476" href="#Page_476"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 476]</span></a>
of symmetrical longitudinal ribs on their inner surfaces,
and the peculiar character of the narrow radii, hardly differing
in structure from the parietes, are characters which
are rare in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, but universal in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>.
Hence, taking the whole organisation of the two species of
<a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, it is certain that they must be ranked amongst
the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, though the leading character of the
group, namely, the rostrum being furnished, like the carina,
with alæ, here fails. Owing to this conviction, I examined
very young individuals of <a href="#Pachylasma_giganteum"><i>P. giganteum</i></a>, and in specimens
only the 1/100th of an inch in height, I was interested by
finding eight separate compartments, with the rostrum
having distinct alæ; hence, at this early age, as far as the
shell is concerned, this species may be said to be an <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>;
and we have seen that this likewise holds good
with the included animal's body; as the young shell increases
in size the minute rostrum and rostro-lateral compartments
blend together (Pl. <a href="#Page_703">19</a>, fig. <a href="#p19f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>), without even
traces of sutures being left.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_134_134" id="Footnote_134_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_134_134"><span class="label">[134]</span></a> Dr. Philippi called this species a Chthamalus; giving this generic name
from an examination only of the separated valves in a fossil condition.</p></div>

<p>With respect to <a href="#Pachylasma_aurantiacum"><i>Pachylasma aurantiacum</i></a>, I have no doubt
that at an early age it would possess a perfectly distinct
rostrum with alæ; for in the one specimen which I have seen,
the compound rostrum is divided by sutures, faintly visible,
both externally and internally (Pl. <a href="#Page_704">20</a>, fig. <a href="#p20f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#p20f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), into three
compartments (<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>), of which the middle one, or true
rostrum, still shows, in the manner in which it underlaps the
little rostro-lateral compartments, vestiges of alæ. I may remark,
that we have here the same structure as in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>,
formerly described, with the following differences, that here
the sutures pass through the outer lamina of the parietes, so
that, as seen externally, the separation of the three compartments
is much more perfect than in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>; on the
other hand, internally, the separation is less distinct, as the
two rudimentary rostro-lateral compartments do not form
part of the sheath. <a href="#Pachylasma_aurantiacum"><i>Pachylasma aurantiacum</i></a> is further remarkable,
from the two lateral compartments (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>) on each
side, tending to blend together, being only separated by
sutures not more distinct, externally, than those separating
the compound rostrum, but more distinct internally, for
they run up the sheath. From these facts it follows, that<a name="Page_477" id="Page_477" href="#Page_477"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 477]</span></a>
this species, viewed outside, without particular care, would
be said to consist, like an <a href="#Genus_Elminius">Elminius</a> or <a href="#Genus_Chamaesipho">Chamæsipho</a>, of
only four compartments; if the sheath alone were looked
at, there would be said to be six compartments; but when
the walls, especially their basal edges, are carefully examined,
either internally or externally, the eight compartments can
be plainly distinguished.</p>

<p>With respect to the affinities of this genus, we have seen
that both in the included animal's body, and, at an early age,
in the shell, it is extremely close to <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>: in the presence
of caudal appendages, and in the basis being calcareous, we
have a clear affinity with <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>; in the two lateral
compartments of <a href="#Pachylasma_aurantiacum"><i>P. aurantiacum</i></a>, tending to become blended
together, we have some relationship exhibited to <a href="#Genus_Chamaesipho">Chamæsipho</a>,
as is likewise shown in the structure of the second
and third pairs of cirri. If the genera of the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>
were ranged in a circle, <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a> would be the point
of contact with the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>. I must repeat, that it is
extremely unfortunate that when the shell alone of <a href="#Pachylasma_giganteum"><i>P.
giganteum</i></a> is examined, it is hardly possible to separate this
genus from <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>.</p>

<div class="detail">

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, rugged, irregular, with the
lines of growth plain; colour dead dirty white. Orifice large,
diamond-shaped, narrow towards the carinal end; notched. Radii
narrow, barely distinct from the parietes; in the same individual
sometimes absent, and sometimes forming a mere ribbon, confined
to the lower edge of a compartment. The diametric growth is
effected by the alæ, which seen externally are broad, and strongly
marked by lines of growth. Basal diameter of largest recent specimen
1.15; height of highest compartment (a carina) 1.4; and width
at base of widest rostrum .85 of an inch. Amongst the fossil specimens,
height of highest compartment (a carina) 1.8, width of the
same one inch; width of widest rostrum 1.1 of a inch. One of these
carinæ, a little below the middle point, was actually .3 of an inch in
thickness, from which circumstance I have given the generic name of
<a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, triangular, but the width varies a little: growth-ridges prominent,
sinuous, with a few slight furrows radiating from the apex of
the valve. Internally, the articular ridge is not very prominent; nor
is there a deep depression for the adductor muscle, and none for the
lateral depressor muscles. The upper part of the valve projects freely.</p>

<p><i>Terga</i>, broad, broader than the scuta: the growth-ridges are prominent,
and angularly upturned close along the scutal margin; the
carinal half of the valve is smooth, with the faintest traces of longitudinal
striæ. A portion of the valve, nearly half of its entire width
on the scutal side, is slightly depressed below the general level, and
depends slightly beneath the basal margin on the carinal side: this
evidently forms the spur. The carinal margin is nearly straight,
with the lines of growth upturned along it. Internally, the articular
ridge in the upper part is extremely prominent: the crests for the
depressor muscles are very prominent, and depend beneath the basal
margin like a comb: they extend over nearly half the basal margin,
and the muscle, in a corresponding manner, is unusually spread out.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell and Radii</i>: the compartments are attached to
each other less strongly than in any other cirripede which I have examined,
so that when dried specimens are soaked in spirits of wine they
generally fall to pieces with a touch. In full and half-grown specimens
the carino-lateral compartments are nearly as broad as the lateral compartments;
in very young specimens, about 1/20th of an inch in basal diameter,
they are proportionally much narrower. The <i>walls</i> are strong even
in young specimens; in old ones they attain a thickness I have scarcely
seen equalled except in <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>. Their internal surfaces are smooth,
as is the basal internal margin in young specimens, but in old specimens
it is roughened with short, blunt ridges and little points. The
<i>Radii</i> are often absent; when present they are very narrow, and consist
merely of a ribbon-like portion, formed by obliquely upturned
layers of growth, more prominent than on the parietes. The <i>Alæ</i> are
very largely developed; they are added to, during the diametric
growth of the shell, in a regular sweep all the way down to the basal
margin, and consequently they do not form a rectangular shoulder as
is usual; externally they are plainly marked by lines of growth: they<a name="Page_479" id="Page_479" href="#Page_479"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 479]</span></a>
are added to a little above the line of attachment of the opercular membrane;
their summits are very oblique. The sheath has its basal edge
slightly hollowed out.</p>

<p><i>Basis</i>, solid, calcareous, very irregular, and of variable thickness.</p>

<p>I have, under the Genus, alluded to the structure of the rostrum: in
one shell, the basal diameter of which barely exceeded 1/20th of an inch;
the compound rostrum (being 5/200ths of an inch in height), had its
basal margin (being 9/200ths of an inch in width) rendered deeply
sinuous (see Pl. <a href="#Page_703">19</a>, fig. <a href="#p19f05b">5 <i>b</i></a>) by two indentations, corresponding with
and caused by two notches at the top of the valve. These two notches
extended down barely 1/100th of an inch (strictly 4/1000ths) from
the summit and then disappeared; so that when the shell was under
1/100th of an inch in height, (only one distinct zone of growth having
been formed), the now compound rostrum consisted of three separate
compartments; and there were eight compartments altogether. Of the
above three little compartments, the middle one, or true rostrum, had
large alæ, which could be most distinctly seen, extending on both sides,
under the little rudimentary rostro-lateral compartments. These latter
overlapped the compartments on both sides of them, as in all the
<a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum bullate, with no central notch; nor is the inner
fold of the labrum, forming the supra-œsophageal cavity, thickened, as in
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>: minute muscles run from this inner fold straight back to the
cavity formed by the outer bullate fold: the crest of the labrum is
hairy, with a row of the minutest bead-like points or teeth. <i>Palpi</i>,
small, broad, placed almost parallel to the sides of the mouth, with
their apices not nearly touching each other. <i>Mandibles</i>, with three
large nearly equal-sized <em>single</em> teeth; the whole inferior angle strongly
pectinated. <i>Maxillæ</i>, small, with a broad, square notch beneath the
two or three great upper spines.</p>

<p><i>Cirri</i>: first pair short, with the rami equal in length. Second pair,
with the anterior ramus having broader segments than those of the
posterior ramus, and with all the segments, except the few uppermost,
thickly covered with spines; the posterior ramus has rather less than
half the segments thickly covered. Third pair, very slightly shorter
than the sixth pair; anterior ramus with the lower segments, less than
half of the whole in number, thickly covered with spines; posterior
ramus with only the lowest segments, about one fifth of the entire number,
thickly covered; the other segments of these two rami, and the
upper segments of the posterior ramus of the second pair, closely
resemble in the regular arrangement of their spines in pairs, the three
posterior pairs of cirri. The pedicel of the third pair supports numerous,
irregularly scattered bristles. The segments of the sixth pair bear
four or five pairs of main spines, with a few intermediate spines.</p>

<p><i>Caudal Appendages.</i>—Multiarticulate, narrow, tapering, situated on
each side of the anus: each segment has two little tufts of spines on
each side of its upper edge. These appendages are about one third
longer than the pedicel of the sixth pair of cirri: in a specimen, in
which the rami of the sixth pair had twenty-three segments, the caudal
appendages had nineteen segments.</p>

<p><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480" href="#Page_480"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 480]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Penis</i> short, hairy, finely-ringed, with no projecting point at its
dorsal basis. <i>Branchiæ</i> moderately large, nearly circular, not much
plicated.</p>

<p><i>Fossil Specimens.</i>—With respect to the Sicilian specimens sent me
by Dr. Philippi and Sir C. Lyell, I can see no difference whatever from
the recent specimens, excepting in their greater size and thickness;
it must, however, be borne in mind that I have seen only half-a-dozen
recent shells. The one fossil scutum which I have seen is rather
broader than is usual with the recent, but I have seen one nearly as
broad. This species seems to have been extremely common when the
beds at Messina were deposited, and probably it attained a larger size
than it does at present. The compartments are always found separated,
which is easily understood, by the facility with which, as above
stated, recent specimens fall to pieces.</p></div>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell conical, smooth, with a tinge of orange
colour; orifice large, deeply notched, sub-triangular. Viewed externally,
the compartments in appearance are only four; but on close
examination, the lateral compartments are seen to be divided by a very
fine fissure into two nearly equal compartments. The rostrum is
broad and flat, and when carefully examined, it also is seen to be
divided by two fine fissures into three compartments; of these the
middle one, or true rostrum, is a very little broader than the rostro-lateral
compartment on each side; hence, on careful examination, the
shell is found to consist of eight compartments. The carina is much
compressed. The radii (in my one specimen) are not developed. The
carina, and the two lateral compartments alone, have alæ; for the carino-lateral
compartments are too closely joined to the lateral compartments,
and the true rostrum is too closely joined to the rostro-lateral compartments,
to have their alæ developed. The four alæ which are
developed, are very broad, widely exposed, and marked externally by
lines of growth. The basal diameter of my one, apparently old
specimen, is one inch.</p>

<p><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481" href="#Page_481"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 481]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Structure of Shell, &amp;c.</i>—The inner surface (fig. <a href="#p20f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>) of the rather thick
parietes is smooth, except close to the base, where it is roughened
by a few irregular points. The sheath descends low down, and has its
lower edge slightly free. The sutures are much plainer on the internal
than on the external surface, and can be here plainly seen to be eight
in number. That portion of the carino-lateral compartment, which
helps to form the sheath, is narrow, though the whole compartment is
of very nearly equal width with the lateral compartment. It is a singular
fact, that no portion of the rostro-lateral compartment helps to form
the sheath; for the alæ of the lateral compartments, overlap the whole
upper part of the rostro-lateral compartments, and abut against the
true rostrum. Hence, when the sheath alone is examined, the number
of the compartments appears only six. In a section the true rostrum
can be seen to underlie the rostro-lateral compartments, and thus
exhibits vestiges of alæ. The fact of the rudimentary rostro-lateral
compartments not forming a part of the sheath offers a marked difference
from <a href="#Genus_Chelonobia">Chelonobia</a>, which otherwise has this part of the shell very
similarly constructed. The diametric growth of the shell, which seems
to be considerable, is effected by the four large alæ of the carina
and of the lateral compartment on each side. The sutural edges of the
alæ are added to in a regularly inclined line down to the basis. The
<i>basis</i> is calcareous, and not very thin.</p>

<p>Both opercular valves (fig. <a href="#p20f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p20f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>) closely resemble those of the
last species.</p>

<p>The <i>Scuta</i> are remarkably narrow and elongated: the external
surface is slightly furrowed longitudinally, the prominent lines of
growth are much wrinkled. The articular ridge is blunt, and not very
prominent. The upper part of the valve is reflexed, and a considerable
portion must have projected freely. The <i>Terga</i> are nearly twice as
broad as the scuta: the carinal half of the valve is very smooth, and is
coloured beautiful reddish-orange. The spur is tolerably distinct. The
articular ridge is not very prominent.</p>

<p>The <i>Mouth</i> resembles that of the last species. The mandibles have
three sharp teeth, with the inferior part narrow and pectinated with
long spines: the edge, also, between the upper main teeth, is pectinated
with short spines, which latter often have their summits crenated. The
<i>maxillæ</i> are notched; the inferior corner is produced into a small
step-formed projection. The outer maxillæ are more pointed than is usual.</p>

<p>The <i>Cirri</i> most closely resemble in every detail those of <a href="#Pachylasma_giganteum"><i>P. giganteum</i></a>;
I can point out only one slight difference, namely, that the lower
segments, in the posterior ramus of the third cirrus, which are thickly
clothed with spines, are more numerous in proportion to the upper
segments with the spines arranged in regular pairs (being as 4 to 14),
than in <a href="#Pachylasma_giganteum"><i>P. giganteum</i></a>, in which only one fifth (or 4 to 20) are so clothed.</p>

<p><i>Caudal Appendages.</i>—These are very small, not being more than
one fifth of the length of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus: their segments
are indistinct, and they support a very few coarse spines. The rami of
the sixth cirrus, in the one specimen, had twenty-five segments, whilst
each caudal appendage had only five. Hence the caudal appendages
are far less developed than in <a href="#Pachylasma_giganteum"><i>P. giganteum</i></a>.</p></div>

<p class="p2">The two species of this genus differ considerably in
external appearance, though not in essential character.
Both, as the name expresses, have eight compartments: the
carino-lateral pair are rather narrower than the lateral. The
basis is membranous. The radii are narrow, and are distinctly
crenated on both sides of the sutures with the teeth
neatly interlocking; but these teeth can hardly be distinguished
in the large, corroded specimens of <a href="#Octomeris_angulosa"><i>O. angulosa</i></a>.
The crenated structure of the radii is identical with that
described under <a href="#Chthamalus_dentatus"><i>Chthamalus dentatus</i></a> and <a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>Hembeli</i></a>; if,
indeed, we were to add carino-lateral compartments to
the shells of these two species, they would belong to <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>.
I have seen only a few specimens of either species
of <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>, and none preserved in spirits; and therefore
I know nothing of the anatomy of the softer parts:
I was not able to make out distinctly any branchiæ. The
cirri differ considerably in the two species, in nearly the
same way as in the two species of <a href="#Genus_Chamaesipho">Chamæsipho</a>. In the
structure of the second pair of cirri, and in the tendency of the
basal margin of the parietes to form bay-like indentations,
<a href="#Octomeris_angulosa"><i>Octomeris angulosa</i></a> shows some special affinity to <a href="#Chamaesipho_scutelliformis"><i>Chamæsipho

was closely related to <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>; and I have just alluded to
the close affinity of the latter to the division of the genus

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance and Structure of Shell.</i>—Shell extremely rugged,
irregular, massive, generally much corroded, steeply conical
or even sub-cylindrical: orifice large, broad, rhomboidal, of nearly
equal breadth at both ends. Colour dirty white, often slightly tinted
yellow from the investing membrane, and from thin layers of punctured
membrane alternating with the laminæ of shell. The parietes, in old
specimens, have very irregular longitudinal ridges, or rather plates
projecting out, sometimes much branched, and generally curved
inwards so as to meet each other, thus forming round the basal margin
a circle of cylindrical apertures. In old large specimens the radii are
not developed, and till the compartments are disarticulated there is no
trace of the toothed structure of their sutural edges: in this condition
the sutures exist as deep, rugged, narrow fissures. In younger
shells, the radii, though narrow, are distinct, and have their surfaces
transversely ribbed, and their edges toothed and interlocked with the
teeth of the recipient furrow. Some of the specimens present a
curiously deceptive resemblance to <a href="#Elminius_plicatus"><i>Elminius plicatus</i></a>. Basal diameter
of largest specimen, one inch and a quarter; height one inch.</p>

<p>The parietes are remarkably thick, but the compartments separate
easily: I have, however, seen one instance in which they were partially
calcified together. Their internal surfaces are very smooth. The sheath
does not descend low. The alæ project rectangularly; they have thick
edges, and these are coarsely crenated in transverse lines. Of the radii
sufficient has been said.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i> (fig. <a href="#p20f02b">2 <i>b</i></a>): these, in all the specimens seen by me but one, have
been deeply corroded, and their outline, as in <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, considerably
modified: in the one specimen well preserved, the exterior growth-ridges
were extremely prominent. The articular ridge does not project
much, nor is the articular furrow very deep. There are more or less
distinct crests for the lateral depressor muscles. The <i>Terga</i> are rather<a name="Page_484" id="Page_484" href="#Page_484"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 484]</span></a>
narrow, with a small rounded spur, moderately distinct. The tips of
the crests for the depressor muscle barely depend beneath the basal
margin.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum considerably bullate, with the crest hairy and furnished
with a few most minute teeth. Palpi small, with their tips not
nearly touching each other. Mandibles with four teeth, of which the
lower ones are laterally double: inferior pectinated portion small. The
maxillæ are notched, but their outline differed on opposite sides of the
individual examined. Outer maxillæ bilobed on their inner face.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The first pair has the rami unequal in length by about three
segments, having six segments on one and nine on the other ramus. In
the second pair the anterior ramus is remarkably short and extremely
broad; the five segments of which it is composed being thickly covered
with bristles, some of which are very coarsely and doubly pectinated:
the posterior ramus is nearly twice as long as the anterior ramus, and
has eleven segments; of these, excepting the two basal segments which
are rather thickly covered with spines, the others resemble in the
arrangement of their spines the four posterior pairs of cirri, with the
exception that there is a single transverse row of rather long spines
along the upper and inner lateral edge of each segment. The segments
in all the four posterior pairs of cirri resemble each other in bearing
each four pairs of main spines (of which the two lower pairs are short),
with a tuft of small intermediate spines.</p>

<p>The penis is remarkable from its very small size and shortness, not
being more than once and a half as long as the pedicel of the sixth
cirrus.</p></div>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance and Structure.</i>—Shell circular, much depressed;
coloured brown, with an orange-red tint; surface regularly and narrowly
furrowed in longitudinal lines, the intermediate rounded ridges
projecting at the basal margin in finger-like points. The eight compartments,
when disarticulated, are of nearly equal sizes; the carino-lateral
and rostro-lateral compartments being rather smaller than the
others. The radii are neatly toothed; but with the exception of these
teeth, which are equally developed on both sides of the sutures, and
which closely interlock in the lower part of the shell, but stand a little
apart in the upper part, the radii can hardly be said to be developed.
The alæ do not form a rectangular shoulder, the lower margin being
regularly curved into the parietes; the upper margin is only slightly<a name="Page_485" id="Page_485" href="#Page_485"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 485]</span></a>
oblique; the external surface is furrowed by lines of growth. The
shell increases a little in diameter, chiefly by the growth of the alæ.
The parietes are not very thick, with the inner surface smooth, but
with punctures placed in rows for the entrance of the tubuli: the
laminæ of shell alternate with layers of yellow finely punctured membrane.
Basis formed of thin membrane, in concentric slips. Basal
diameter of largest specimen, .6 of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i> broad, with the lines of growth few in number, but extremely
prominent, so as to form folds: basal margin with a very slight angular
bend: articular ridge not very prominent. <i>Terga</i>, with a narrow slip
along the scutal margin, having the lines or folds of growth so prominent
as almost to form a series of small transverse pits: the basal
margin of this portion forms an angle with the rest of the basal
margin: no spur can be said to exist: the crests for the depressor
muscle depend a little beneath the basal margin: articular ridge very
prominent.</p>

<p><i>Mouth</i>: labrum and palpi as in the last species. Mandibles with
three main teeth, apparently single, of which the lower tooth has its
upper edge pectinated: the inferior part of the mandible is pectinated
as usual. The maxillæ have two notches, one beneath the two upper
large spines, and the other in the middle, separating some thicker and
thinner spines.</p>

<p><i>Cirri</i>: first and second pairs short, with the anterior rami in each
longer by about two segments than the posterior rami; all the segments
thickly covered with bristles. The third cirrus is much longer
than the second cirrus, with the posterior ramus longer than the anterior
ramus; on the latter the three basal segments, and on the posterior
ramus the two basal segments are thickly covered with bristles;
the other segments have bristles arranged as on the three posterior
pairs of cirri, namely, each segment has four pairs of main spines, of
which the two lower pairs are short.</p>

<p>The unarticulated support, whence the articulated portion of the penis
arises, is unusually long, equalling the pedicel of the sixth cirrus.</p></div>

or calcareous.</i></p>

<div class="habitat">

<p class="p2"><i>Distribution</i>, West Indies and Australia. Attached to littoral shells and rocks.</p></div>


<p class="p2">This genus is very remarkable amongst sessile cirripedes,
from the eight normal compartments of the shell being<a name="Page_486" id="Page_486" href="#Page_486"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 486]</span></a>
surrounded by several whorls of supplemental compartments
or scales: these are arranged symmetrically, and decrease in
size but increase in number towards the circumference and
basal margin. A well preserved specimen has a very elegant
appearance, like certain compound flowers, which when half
open are surrounded by imbricated and graduated scales.
The <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a>, in the structure of the mouth and cirri,
and to a certain extent in that of the shell, fill up the
interval between the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> and Lepadidæ; and <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>
forms, in a very remarkable manner, the transitional
link, for it is impossible not to be struck with the
resemblance of its shell with the capitulum of Pollicipes.
In Pollicipes, at least in certain species, the scuta and terga
are articulated together—the carina, rostrum, and three
pairs of latera, making altogether eight inner valves, are
considerably larger than those in the outer whorls—the
arrangement of the latter, their manner of growth and
union,—all are as in <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>. If we, in imagination,
unite some of the characters found in the different
species of Pollicipes, and then make the peduncle so short
(and it sometimes is very short in <i>P. mitella</i>) that the valves
of the capitulum should touch the surface of attachment, it
would be impossible to point out a single <em>external</em> character
by which the two genera in these two distinct families could
be distinguished: but the more important differences in the
arrangement and nature of the muscles which are attached
either to the opercular valves or surround the inside of the
peduncle, would yet remain.</p>

<p>Although all the valves of the shell, even the eight in
the innermost whorl, are very thin, yet from their number
in the successive whorls, and from each being concave inwards,
so as to form a cavity or tube into which the corium
enters, the total thickness of the sides of the shell is very
considerable. Both of the species of <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a> occurred
mingled, in the one case with <a href="#Tetraclita_porosa"><i>Tetraclita porosa</i></a> and
in the other with <a href="#Tetraclita_purpurascens"><i>T. purpurascens</i></a>; now the walls of these
shells, we know, are very thick, and are permeated by
several rows of pores, occupied by threads of corium; seeing
this, we may be permitted to believe, that the several
exterior whorls of valves in <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>, between which<a name="Page_487" id="Page_487" href="#Page_487"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 487]</span></a>
the corium is prolonged for some way upwards, are of
service to the animal, by thickening its shell, in an analogous,
but not homologous, manner, as in <a href="#Genus_Tetraclita">Tetraclita</a>.</p>

<p>Considering the whole structure, external and internal,
of <a href="#Genus_Catophragmus">Catophragmus</a>, with the one great exception of the exterior
whorls of valves, there is hardly a single generic
character by which it can be separated from <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a> and
<a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>; indeed, I am not quite sure that it would not
have been better to have run these three genera together.</p>

<p>Of the two species, I will first describe <a href="#Catophragmus_polymerus"><i>C. polymerus</i></a>,
and not the <i>C. imbricatus</i> of Sowerby, inasmuch as I have
plenty of excellent specimens of the former, whereas the
original specimens of <a href="#Catophragmus_imbricatus"><i>C. imbricatus</i></a>, in the British Museum,
consist of one old and not perfect shell, without the opercular
valves or the included animal's body; and the other,
though quite perfect, far from mature. As far as these
materials allow of minute comparison, the whole shell, with
the exception of the basis, and the opercular valves agree
very closely in the two species, whereas the included animal's
body differs more than is usual in nearly related species;—thus,
<a href="#Catophragmus_imbricatus"><i>C. imbricatus</i></a> has caudal appendages, of which
there is no trace in <a href="#Catophragmus_polymerus"><i>C. polymerus</i></a>, and I have seen only one
other instance in which this organ was absent in one species
(<i>Scalpellum villosum</i>) and present in the other species of the
same genus. Under these circumstances it will be most
convenient first to describe in detail <a href="#Catophragmus_polymerus"><i>C. polymerus</i></a>, and then
only indicate the points of difference in <a href="#Catophragmus_imbricatus"><i>C. imbricatus</i></a>.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>General Appearance.</i>—Shell nearly circular, moderately or slightly
depressed; colour <span class="correction" title="In the original book: grey">gray</span>. The eight normal compartments of the
inner whorl are two or three times as large as those in the second
whorl; the other smaller compartments or scales graduate very regu<a name="Page_488" id="Page_488" href="#Page_488"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 488]</span></a>larly
in size, to mere beads, at the extreme basal edge, and are arranged
symmetrically. The general aspect of the shell depends chiefly on
the degree to which the surface has been disintegrated, and differs
greatly in the two extreme states. When well preserved, the general
appearance is very elegant; the scales are all neatly imbricated; they
terminate upwards in points, but with their extreme tips generally
broken; from laterally overlapping each other, their external surfaces
(as seen, when <span class="correction" title="In the original book: corrroded">corroded</span>, in fig. <a href="#p20f04d">4 <i>d</i></a>, or when slightly exposed after the
continued growth of their basal margins, in fig. <a href="#p20f04a">4 <i>a</i></a>) become longitudinally
keeled, often with a secondary ridge or shoulder on one side;
they are, also, crossed by rather conspicuous and regular lines of
growth, or more strictly, former lines of union between the several
valves: the orifice of the shell in this perfect condition is sub-rhomboidal
and notched, and the scuta are united to the terga by
nearly straight sutures. On the other hand, when the shell has been
considerably corroded, and this seems to be the more common condition,
the appearance is not elegant: the scales in the successive
whorls are not imbricated, but owing to their upper parts having
been worn down, they present a tesselated surface (<a href="#p20f04d">4 <i>d</i></a>), with the
tesseræ graduated in size, and of a peculiar shape, namely, a rectangle,
with a more or less broad square projection on the exterior side, together
often with a large square notch on one or both corners, caused
by their laterally overlapping each other. Some of the shells are so
deeply corroded, that no portion of the original surface is preserved,
excepting the lowermost bead-like scales; and the whole shell has so
rugged an aspect, that the successive whorls of the worn-down valves
might easily be overlooked. In the corroded specimens, the orifice
approaches to circular in outline, and is large and nearly entire: the
scuta and terga are deeply interlocked together. The largest specimen
which I have seen was one inch and a quarter in basal diameter.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Shell.</i>—The eight inner normal compartments are
not thicker than the outer valves, and are far thinner than in ordinary
sessile cirripedes. They are arranged as in <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>. The lateral
compartments are broader than the rostro-lateral and carino-lateral compartments.
The shelly laminæ, of which these compartments and the
opercular valves are composed, alternate with yellow membranous layers,
exactly as is the case with <a href="#Genus_Octomeris">Octomeris</a>. The lateral edges of the compartments,
beneath the alæ, in the six compartments having alæ, bend
inwards, especially just above the basis, so that the compartments in
their lower parts (fig. <a href="#p20f04c">4 <i>c</i></a>) stand much more separate than is usual.
The basal edge of each is irregularly toothed. The sheath presents no
particular character. The eight compartments have longitudinal shoulders
and ribs on their external surfaces, caused by the lateral overlapping
and pressure of the exterior scales. They are also marked by slight,
transverse or oblique calcareous ridges, caused by the attachment of the
membrane, by which they are united to the smaller compartments or
scales outside them. A new line of attachment, and consequently a new
ridge is formed, lower and lower down at each period of growth, as the
shell is added to at the basis,—in the same manner as new ridges are
added to the lower edge of the sheath at each period of growth. The<a name="Page_489" id="Page_489" href="#Page_489"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 489]</span></a>
shell, excepting in old worn-down specimens, increases largely by diametric
growth: during the diametric growth, the outer scales must be
laterally separated a little from each other, and probably they are laterally
added to; but there are no distinct lines of suture, or rows of
smaller scales, corresponding with the sutures between the eight inner
compartments. The alæ do not project much; their edges, as well as
the shoulders into which they fit, are generally irregularly crenated:
they are added to during diametric growth above the line of attachment
of the opercular membrane. There is no appearance of radii; but as the
eight inner compartments are added to laterally, and are often crenated,
on the edges which correspond with the radii in other Cirripedes,
such edges must be considered as radii.</p>

<p>With respect to the scales in the several outer whorls, they resemble
each other except in size, and the outermost scales are reduced to mere
transversely elongated beads. Their basal edges are concave inwards,
being bent like the ridge of a house; hence sub-triangular spaces or
tubes, lined by the corium, run up between the scales. When perfectly
preserved, the outline of each scale is a much elongated triangle,
but usually, from their summits having been worn off, the outline is
nearly that of a parallelogram. Their basal edges are dentated, and
their upper parts, both on the outside and inside, are marked, where
joined to the other compartments, by slight calcareous ridges: outside,
there are longitudinal shoulders (Pl. <a href="#Page_704">20</a>, fig. <a href="#p20f04b">4 <i>b</i></a>), caused by the
lateral overlapping of the adjoining scales; these are best seen in section
in corroded specimens (fig. <a href="#p20f04d">4 <i>d</i></a>): on the inside there are, also,
in the upper part, slight medial longitudinal ridges, caused by the
sutures, which the scales have covered.</p>

<p>In large old specimens there are ten, or even more, whorls of compartments,
but it is scarcely possible to count them with any accuracy.
The first whorl consists of the eight large inner compartments, though,
homologically, it is doubtful whether the rostro-lateral compartments
in any sessile cirripede really belong to the same whorl with the others.
The second whorl consists of eight smaller pieces, covering the eight
sutures in the first whorl (see the tracing of the basal edges of all the
compartments and valves in a very perfect specimen, Pl. <a href="#Page_704">20</a>, fig. <a href="#p20f04c">4 <i>c</i></a>).
The third whorl, in large and perfect specimens, consists of twice the
number, or sixteen, still smaller scales, corresponding with the sixteen
sutures of the second whorl; but sometimes there are less than sixteen
pieces, owing to some of the scales being large enough to cover two
adjoining sutures as well as the intermediate portion of the compartments
of the first whorl. In the fourth whorl, instead of there being,
even in the most perfect specimens, twice sixteen, or thirty-two pieces,
there are only twenty-four; this being caused by single pieces (placed
alternately with two pieces) being broad enough to cover two sutures
as well as the intermediate portion of the compartment of the third
whorl. In the succeeding whorls this same arrangement seems to be
the usual one, so that in the fifth whorl, instead of there being, in the
most perfect specimens, twice twenty-four, or forty-eight pieces, that
is, twice the number in the last whorl, there are only thirty-six scales,
or once and a half as many scales.</p>

<p><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490" href="#Page_490"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 490]</span></a></p>

<p>The <i>Basis</i> is thin and membranous; it firmly adheres to the surface
of attachment.</p>

<p><i>Scuta</i>, nearly flat: the articular ridge is very prominent, and there
is a deep articular furrow both above and below; but the precise outline
of the ridge and furrows varies: there is a pit for the adductor muscle,
but no crests or marks for the other muscles. The <i>Terga</i> are remarkable
from the extreme prominence of the articular ridge and depth of
the articular furrow. The basal margin viewed internally seems
straight, so that there appears to be no spur; but viewed externally,
when the crests for the depressor muscles are seen to depend considerably
beneath the true basal margin, a slight, very broad spur
may be perceived to exist. These depending crests for the muscles
are rather thin, but they extend over half the basal margin of the valve.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The labrum is very bullate, being as long in its longitudinal
axis as the rest of the mouth: crest hairy, with some very minute teeth.
Palpi truncated, with their apices not nearly touching each other;
thickly clothed with spines. Mandibles with three large single teeth,
of which the lower one has a single fine tooth at its upper basal edge,
showing a tendency to become pectinated; inferior part short, coarsely
pectinated. Maxillæ notched, with a slight second notch and slight
double prominence in the lower part.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—First and second pairs short, with the rami in each unequal
in length by about four segments; on both rami in the second
cirrus, and in the shorter ramus of the first cirrus, there are some
coarsely pectinated spines. All four posterior cirri are alike; the
segments bear five pairs of strong spines, with a large intermediate
tuft of fine spines: the dorsal tuft is also large, consisting of short
thick, and long finer spines. There is no vestige of <i>caudal appendages</i>,
though present in the succeeding species.</p>

<p>Branchiæ moderately large, in area equalling the prosoma; surface
not plicated.</p></div>

<p class="p2">As stated under the genus, this species is known from two specimens
in the British Museum, one of which is full-sized, being three quarters
of an inch in diameter, but is destitute of the outermost whorls, of the
basis, opercular valves, and animal's body; the other is perfect, but very
young, being barely two tenths of an inch in basal diameter. As far as
the characters can be made out from these materials, I can perceive<a name="Page_491" id="Page_491" href="#Page_491"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 491]</span></a>
no difference from <a href="#Catophragmus_polymerus"><i>C. polymerus</i></a> in the shell, excepting that in the
small specimen of <a href="#Catophragmus_imbricatus"><i>C. imbricatus</i></a>, there would appear to exist fewer
whorls. The opercular valves are likewise closely similar: in the
scuta, however, of the young specimen in the present species, the
articular ridge seems to be a little broader, but this is so variable a
character that no confidence can be placed in it: these valves, moreover,
externally have a broad furrow along the middle, running from
the apex to the basal margin, which is not the case with the scutum of
<a href="#Catophragmus_polymerus"><i>C. polymerus</i></a>; but then I have often seen, in young specimens of
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, a similar furrow, which is quite absent in full-grown specimens.
When we come to the basis we find a good diagnostic character,
for here it is calcareous: it is rather thin, solid, and white; towards the
outside it is pitted with small cavities, corresponding with the small
teeth on the basal edges of the compartments. The latter adhere
firmly to the basis. The central internal surface is covered by an
irregular network of imbedded cement-ducts, some of which bifurcate.
From the description here given, it will be seen that any figure
would have been superfluous, the last species having been so well
illustrated.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—I can point out no difference, excepting that the palpi are
here more oval or less truncated at their ends; and that the lower
corner of the maxillæ seems to be more prominent. In the <i>Cirri</i>, the
rami of the first and second pairs are nearly equal in length: none of
the spines are coarsely pectinated. In the four posterior pairs of cirri,
instead of a tuft of small spines on each segment between the pairs
of main spines, there are only a few minute intermediate spines: the
dorsal tufts are also here smaller, but are, as in the last species, composed
of short thick, and longer thinner spines.</p>

<p><i>Caudal Appendages.</i>—This is the only species of sessile cirripede,
with the exception of the two species of <a href="#Genus_Pachylasma">Pachylasma</a>, which possesses
these organs: they are situated on each side of the anus in the usual
position: they are minute, equalling in length only the lower segment
of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus: in a specimen in which the rami of
the sixth cirrus had eighteen or twenty segments, these appendages
consisted of only three tapering segments, supporting a few thick
spines.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ.</i>—I believe I discovered these, consisting of two minute
pouches, placed at the carinal end of the sack: if this observation be
correct, this species differs from <a href="#Catophragmus_polymerus"><i>C. polymerus</i></a> in the much smaller size
of these organs.</p></div>

<h2><a name="REMARKS_ON_LIST_OF_FOSSILS" id="REMARKS_ON_LIST_OF_FOSSILS" />REMARKS ON BRONN'S LIST OF FOSSIL <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">BALANINÆ</a> AND <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">CHTHAMALINÆ</a>.</h2>


<div class="detail">

<p>The following species of fossil <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> are given in that most useful work,
the 'Enumerator Palæontologicus' in Bronn's 'Gesichte der Natur:' it has
appeared to me that a few words on each species, might hereafter save others
the trouble of searching through several works.</p>

<p><i>Tubicinella maxima</i> of Morren, said to have been found in the Chalk: this
would have been a wonderful fact, considering that no true sessile cirripede
has hitherto been found in this formation, and that it implies the existence of
Cetacea at this period; but I have been informed that the fossil in question is
not a Cirripede.</p>

<p><i>Diadema bifidum</i> = Coronula bifida of Bronn, in his 'Italiens <span class="correction" title="In the orignal book:Tertiar">Tertiär</span>-Gebilde'
(1831), p. 126 (no Plate). Without a much fuller description I can
form no judgment on this species.</p>

<p><i>Diadema vulgare</i> is probably the <a href="#Coronula_barbara"><i>Coronula barbara</i></a>, a Crag fossil described
by me.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgoma undata</i>, Michelotti, in 'Bull. Soc. Geolog.' tom. x, p. 141, a mere
name without any description: probably it is a synonym of</p>

<p><i>Pyrgoma sulcatum</i>, Philippi, 'Enum. Mollusc. Siciliæ,' which is a synonym of
<a href="#Pyrgoma_Anglicum"><i>Pyrgoma Anglicum</i></a> of the present work; found recent and fossil.</p>

<p><i>Acasta Montagui</i> is probably the extinct <a href="#Acasta_undulata"><i>Acasta undulata</i></a> described by me.</p>

<p><i>Chthamalus giganteus</i> of Philippi, is the <a href="#Pachylasma_giganteum"><i>Pachylasma giganteum</i></a> of this work;
found recent and fossil.</p>

<p><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i>, said by Philippi to be found fossil in Sicily; such
may be the case, but the littoral habits of the species do not render it very
probable.</p>

<p><i>Balanus carbonarius</i> of Petzholdt, found in the Carboniferous formation! but
I have given my reasons, in my 'Monograph on the Fossil Lepadidæ,' p. 5, for
disbelieving that this is a <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, or even a Cirripede.</p>

<p><i>Balanus ostrearum</i> appears to be a mere name by Conrad, published by
Morton in his 'Synopsis of the Organic Remains of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Cretacean">Cretaceous</span> Group,'
1834, Appendix, p. 8.</p>

<p><i>Balanus peregrinus</i> is briefly described and poorly figured, without the
opercular valves, by Morton, in his 'Synopsis,' <i>ut supra</i>, p. 72, Pl. 10, fig. 5:
this Eocene species apparently resembles the Eocene <a href="#Balanus_unguiformis"><i>B. unguiformis</i></a> of Sowerby,
described in this work; but quite indispensable details of structure for identification
are not given. Another figure of this shell is given in the 'American
Journal of Science' (N. S.), vol. i, Pl. 2, fig. 6.</p>

<p><i>Balanus circinnatus</i>, <i>communis</i>, and <i>pustula</i>, of Defrance, as well as all the other
species named by him, are described so imperfectly, that the descriptions are of
no value whatever, every description being applicable to every species: I must
add, that the <i>B. communis</i> is not the <i>B. communis</i> of British authors, a name
applied to several forms.</p>

<p><i>Balanus Finchii</i> is briefly described and figured, but without the opercular
valves, by Isaac Lea, in his 'Contributions to Geology,' 1833, p. 211, Pl. 6,
fig. 222. I do not think that I have seen this species.</p>

<p><i>Balanus Holgeri</i>, Geinitz, 'Grundriss der Versteinerungen,' tab. ix, fig. 19.
No opercular valves are given; this species cannot be even approximately
recognised.</p>

<p><i>Balanus proteus</i>, Conrad, 'Fossil Shells of Miocene Formation of U. States,'<a name="Page_493" id="Page_493" href="#Page_493"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 493]</span></a>
p. 77, Pl. 44 (in 'Journal Acad. Nat. Sc.,' Phil., vol. vii, p. 134). I cannot
recognise this species; it resembles <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a>; but as the radii are rather
narrow, and apparently with slightly oblique summits, it may be <a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>B. concavus</i></a>;
the opercular valves are not figured.</p>

<p><i>Balanus sagittata</i> is merely a provisional name without any description,
given in a paper on the Crag by S. Woodward, in the 'London and Edin.
Philosoph. Magazine, Brewster, Taylor, and Phillips,' vol. vii, July-December,
1835, p. 354.</p>

<p><i>Balanus sublævis</i>, J. de C. Sowerby, in 'Geolog. Trans.,' 2d series, vol. v,
Pl. 25, fig. 3. Plate extremely imperfect; description extremely short and
useless; a species from India not to be recognised.</p>

<p><i>Balanus balanoides</i>; the species thus named by Ranzani, and found by Philippi
in Sicily, certainly is not the true <i>Lepas balanoides</i> of Linn., but may be <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>
of this work. In British collections of Crag specimens I have found the
<a href="#Balanus_dolosus"><i>B. dolosus</i></a> (nov. spec.) thus named: I much doubt whether the truly littoral
<a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a> of Linnæus has been found fossil.</p>

<p><i>B. costatus</i> of Montagu, a synonym of <i>B. sulcatus</i> of Bruguière, and of
<a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a> of this work; found fossil and recent. This species was originally
described by Linnæus under the name of <i>Lepas balanus</i>. But the fossil <i>Lepas
balanus</i> of Brocchi is a different species; if it be the same with the recent <i>Lepas
balanus</i> of Poli, then it is the <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a> of the present work. Again, the
<i>B. sulcatus</i> of Bronn, in his 'Lethæa Geognostica' (tab. 36, fig. 14), is quite
different from the <i>B. sulcatus</i> of Bruguière (<i>i. e.</i>, <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a> of the present
work), as is at once obvious from the oblique summits of the radii. Lastly,
<i>B. tesselatus</i> of Sowerby is a synonym of <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B.</i> <span class="correction" title="In the original book: porcatns"><i>porcatus</i></span></a>, <i>sulcatus</i>, <i>costatus</i>, and
<i>Lepas balanus</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. punctatus</i> of Montagu is a synonym of <a href="#Chthamalus_stellatus"><i>Chthamalus stellatus</i></a>, see remarks
on that species: the name of <i>B. punctatus</i> is often applied by British authors to
varieties of <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>B. balanoides</i></a>, see remarks on that species.</p>

<p><i>B. rugosus</i> of Morris's 'Catalogue' is a synonym of <a href="#Balanus_crenatus"><i>B. crenatus</i></a>; found recent
and fossil.</p>

<p><i>B. sulcatus</i> of Bruguière, a synonym of <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a>; found recent and fossil:
see remarks under <i>B. costatus</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a> of Linn., found recent and fossil; but no trust whatever
ought to be placed in the identifications of this species given in several works;
thus the <i>Lepas tintinnabulum</i> of Brocchi is distinct. The <i>B. crassus</i> of Sowerby
is the true <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>. The <i>B. fasciatus</i> of Dujardin (perhaps only a
MS. name) probably is also this species. The <i>B. crispatus</i> is only a variety of
<a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>B. dentiformis</i>, Defrance: see <i>B. circinnatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. ornatus</i>, Münster, '<span class="correction" title="In the original book: Beitrage">Beiträge</span> zur Petrifact.,' B. 3, p. 29, tab. vi (1840).
No opercular valves or details of structure of the several species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>
named by Münster, are given, and consequently none can be recognised with
certainty.</p>

<p><i>B. concavus</i> of Bronn, fully described in this work, with the synonyms given;
recent and fossil.</p>

<p><i>B. crassus</i> of Sowerby, a synonym for <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>B. latiradiatus</i>, Münster, probably a synonym of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>, see
remarks under <i>B. ornatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. pectinarius</i>, Bronn ('Italiens <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Tertiar">Tertiär</span>-Gebilde,' p. 128), does not appear to
me fully enough described to be recognised.</p>

<p><i>B. pictus</i> of Münster, possibly a synonym of <a href="#Balanus_amphitrite"><i>B. amphitrite</i></a>: see remarks
under <i>B. ornatus</i> and <a href="#Balanus_balanoides"><i>balanoides</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>B. plicarius</i>, Bronn: see remarks under <i>B. pectinarius</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. porosus</i> of Hausman (according to Münster of Blumenbach). I cannot
recognise this species in Münster's '<span class="correction" title="In the original book: Beitrage">Beiträge</span>.'</p>

<p><i>B. pustularis</i> of Lamarck, 'Animaux sans Vertèbres.' Scarcely one of the<a name="Page_494" id="Page_494" href="#Page_494"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 494]</span></a>
fossil species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, described by Lamarck, can be recognised; the
descriptions are extremely imperfect. There is a figure of <i>B. pustularis</i> in
Münster's '<span class="correction" title="In the original book: Beitrage">Beiträge</span>,' which makes me think that this may be a synonym of
<i>B. concavus</i> of Bronn.</p>

<p><i>B. pyramidalis</i>, Münster: see remarks under <i>B. ornatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. rhomboicus</i>, Bronn: see remarks under <i>B. plicarius</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. squamosus</i>, Defrance: see remarks under <i>B. circinnatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. stellaris</i>, Bronn ('Lethæa Geognostica,' tab. 36, fig. 13). To this species,
<i>Lepas stellaris</i> (I presume a misprint for <i>stellata</i>) of Poli, is given as a
synonym; but the <i>Lepas stellata</i> of Poli is a <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, and this certainly is
not the case with <i>B. stellaris</i>. I have received two specimens from the
Continent named <i>B. stellaris</i>, but they certainly differed from the form so called
by Bronn, for in that, the parietes are said to be porose and the radii very
narrow: these foreign specimens I have named <a href="#Balanus_inclusus"><i>B. inclusus</i></a>. A species described
by me as <a href="#Balanus_corrugatus"><i>B. corrugatus</i></a>, resembles in external appearance the <i>B. stellaris</i> of
Bronn, but it is mere labour in vain to attempt identifying Balani by their
external characters.</p>

<p><i>B. striatus</i>, Defrance: see remarks under <i>B. circinnatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. tertiarius</i>, Risso, 'Hist. Nat. de l'Europe Merid.,' vol. iv. I cannot
recognise this species.</p>

<p><i>B. tesselatus</i>, Sowerby, a synonym of <a href="#Balanus_porcatus"><i>B. porcatus</i></a>; recent and fossil: see
remarks under <i>B. costatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. zonarius</i>, Münster: see remarks under <i>B. ornatus</i>; possibly this is a
synonym of <a href="#Balanus_concavus"><i>B. concavus</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>B. amphimorphus</i>, Lamarck: see remarks under <i>B. pustularis</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. crispatus</i>, <i>var.</i> of <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>B. cylindraceus</i>, Lamarck. From Chenu's 'Illust. Conch.,' in which
work Lamarck's original specimens are figured; it appears that this is the
<a href="#Balanus_psittacus"><i>B. psittacus</i></a> of South America, where it is also found fossil, but assuredly
Lamarck is quite in error when he states that a variety of this species occurs
fossil near Turin. Bronn (in his 'Italiens <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Tertiar">Tertiär</span>-Gebilde,' p. 127) gives as
a synonym to the Turin fossil the <i>Lepas tintinnabulum</i> of Brocchi (in the
'Conchologia Fossile Subapennina,' t. 2, p. 597), and this probably is correct;
and I have hardly any doubt that the <i>Lepas tintinnabulum</i> of Brocchi is the
<i>B. concavus</i> of Bronn described in the present work.</p>

<p><i>B. perforatus</i> of Bruguière is said by Philippi to be found in Sicily: see
remarks under <i>B. tulipa</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. semiplicatus</i>, Lamarck: see remarks under <i>B. pustularis</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. tulipa</i> of Müller is the <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a> of this work, under which name full
information on its geological history has been given. The <i>B. tulipa</i> of Poli
and Ranzani is the <a href="#Balanus_tulipiformis"><i>B. tulipiformis</i></a> of the present work; and this latter species
is said by Philippi to occur fossil in Sicily. But there has been so much confusion
in the identification of <a href="#Balanus_tulipiformis"><i>B. tulipiformis</i></a>, <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a>, and <a href="#Balanus_tintinnabulum"><i>B. tintinnabulum</i></a>,
and likewise of <a href="#Balanus_perforatus"><i>B. perforatus</i></a> (which by Poli was wrongly considered to be
<i>L. balanus</i>, Linn.), that doubts must be entertained about which have been
really found, until the Sicilian fossils are all carefully examined.</p>

<p><i>B. ovularis</i>, Lamarck: see remarks under <i>B. pustularis</i>.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Uddewallensis"><i>Uddevallensis</i></span>, Linnæus, is probably a synonym of the <a href="#Balanus_Hameri"><i>B. Hameri</i></a> of this
work and the <i>B. tulipa</i> of Müller.</p>

<p>[A few other references may be added to those given by Bronn.]</p>

<p><i>B. miser</i>, stated by Lamarck to be found fossil: see remarks under <i>B.
pustularis</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. patellaris</i> of Lamarck, is stated by Marcel de Serres to be found fossil
with several other species of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>; thus named without any description in
the 'Annales des Scien. Phys. et Nat. de Lyon,' tom. i, p. 417.</p>

<p><i>B. virgatus</i>, <i>delphinus</i>, and <i>crispus</i>, are names given by Defrance, with absolutely
worthless descriptions.</p>

<p><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495" href="#Page_495"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 495]</span></a></p>

<p><i>B. radiatus</i> is too briefly described by Risso ('Hist. Nat. de l'Europe Merid.,'
tom. iv, 1826), without a figure, to be recognised; it probably is not the <i>B.
radiatus</i> of Spengler, Wood, and other authors.</p>

<p><i>B. goissopomo</i>, <i>lævis</i>, and <i>radiatus</i>, are mere names without any description,
published in a Catalogue by F. Hoeninghaus, in the 'Jahrbuch für Mineral.
Geog.,' &amp;c., 1831, p. 155.</p>

<p><i>B. humilis</i>. Conrad, in the 'American Journal of Science,' vol. ii (N. S.),
p. 400, 1846, has given a short description, with a woodcut, of this species,
from the upper Eocene of Florida. The opercular valves are not described, and
I doubt whether the species could be recognised.</p></div>

<h2><a name="Family_Verrucidae" id="Family_Verrucidae" />2. Family—<span class="smcap">V<span class="lowercase">ERRUCIDÆ</span></span>.</h2>

<p><i>Cirripedia without a peduncle: scuta and terga, not furnished
with depressor muscles, moveable only on one side, on
the other side united immoveably with the rostrum and carina
into an asymmetrical shell.</i></p>


<p class="p2">The one genus herein contained differs so considerably
from all the others in the Order, in the extraordinary unequal
development of the two sides of the shell, that I have
instituted a Family for its reception. If compelled to place
it in one of the foregoing families, I should with much
hesitation rank it in the <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">sub-family Chthamalinæ</a>, rather
than amongst the Lepadidæ; for it is destitute of a
peduncle, and has a shell, though a very different one from
that of any true sessile cirripede. In the interfolding
sutures which may be considered as representing radii or
alæ, in the basis being divided into concentric slips, and in
the whole of the basis being attached to the supporting object,
this same line of affinity is clearly manifested. On the
other hand, in the general shape, manner of growth, and
kind of articulation of the scutum and tergum, there is so
close an approach to the Lepadidæ, that had I seen these
very important valves separately, I should certainly have
concluded that they had come from a Pollicipes, allied to
certain Cretacean fossil species, as <i>P. fallax</i> and <i>elegans</i>;
it likewise, perhaps, deserves notice, that the upward
growth of the rostrum, in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>Verruca nexa</i></a>, is a peculiarity<a name="Page_496" id="Page_496" href="#Page_496"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 496]</span></a>
found only in the valves of the Lepadidæ. <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> differs
both from the Lepadidæ and <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> in the whole shell
or external covering, having no other muscle besides the
adductor scutorum. In the characters derived from the
animal's body, <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> approaches both families; but in
the absence of branchiæ, and in the great development of
the caudal appendages, perhaps it comes rather the nearest
to the Lepadidæ. Whatever affinity there is to the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>,
it is much stronger to the sub-family <a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a> than to
the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>; though the non-bullate labrum, in three of
the species, and the great dissimilarity of the third cirrus
from the three posterior pairs, at first seems to indicate a
closer relationship to the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>; but the labrum is never
notched, as in the latter sub-family, and in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a> it is
bullate, and supports palpi of only small size. The dissimilarity,
also, of the third pair of cirri, compared with the
posterior pairs, is hardly greater than in <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>Chthamalus intertextus</i></a>
and <a href="#Chamaesipho_columna"><i>Chamæsipho columna</i></a>, members of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book, this word was italicized."><a href="#Sub-Family_Chthamalinae">Chthamalinæ</a></span>,
though abnormal in this one respect. Perhaps even
a special affinity is evinced between certain species of
<a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>, as <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>C. intertextus</i></a>, and certain species of <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>,
as <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>, namely, in the interfolding sutures and in the
very peculiar, inflected basal margin of the walls. Upon
the whole, the affinities of the <a href="#Family_Verrucidae">Verrucidæ</a> are complex, and
nearly equally divided between the two great families of
<a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> and Lepadidæ, or sessile and pedunculated
cirripedes.</p>

<p class="p2">The shell in this genus is extremely unsymmetrical, not
two of the six pieces of which it is composed quite resembling
each other. At first it appeared hopelessly difficult
to identify, in a homological sense, these six valves, with
those of ordinary cirripedes, but the difficulty soon quite
vanished. The operculum consists of two moveable valves
on one side, namely, a scutum and tergum, but without any
moveable valves on the opposed side: the scutum, though
remarkable from being much smaller than the tergum, can
be easily recognised by giving attachment to the animal's
body and to the adductor scutorum muscle. The four other
pieces are articulated together, and form the shell surrounding
the sack, in which the animal's body is enclosed: of
these, the two against which the moveable scutum and
tergum shut, are smaller, differ greatly in shape, and are
articulated together in a different manner from the remaining
two pieces; from these facts alone there would be a
strong presumption that they were of a different nature.
The fixed valve, against which the scutum shuts, is either
furnished with a remarkably prominent plate (<i>a</i> in fig. <a href="#p21f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>,
<i>s′</i>; compare this with <i>s′</i> in the reversed shell in fig. <a href="#p21f01e">1 <i>e</i></a>), or is
hollowed out, as in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>, for the attachment of the
adductor scutorum muscle. Thus it is rendered probable
that this fixed valve is a modified scutum; but a surface of
attachment for one end of the adductor muscle might, perhaps,
have been developed on any other valve, or a scutum
might have become fused with a lateral valve of the shell;
the shell on this latter view being rendered in idea more
symmetrical. But when a very young specimen is carefully
examined, it is found that the moveable and fixed
scutum, the moveable tergum and its opposed valve or fixed
tergum, at the first period of calcification, resemble each
other quite closely; but that, as each zone of shell is added,
the differences become rapidly greater and greater: hence,<a name="Page_498" id="Page_498" href="#Page_498"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 498]</span></a>
it may be considered as directly proved, that the two fixed
valves (<span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">T′</span> in all the figures in Pl. <a href="#Page_705">21</a>), which are
opposed to the moveable valves of the operculum (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>),
consist of an extraordinarily modified scutum and tergum.
It has been shown (p. <a href="#Page_129">129</a>), that at the period of the metamorphosis,
the two scuta, the two terga, and the carina of
the Lepadidæ, commence their growth, under the form of
the so-called "primordial valves," and so differ from all the
other valves when such occur: now, in two species of
<a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>, I have found closely analogous primordial valves
on the apices of both the moveable and fixed scutum and
tergum (thus affording strong additional evidence that their
nature has been rightly interpreted), and on one of the two
remaining valves, namely, that at the posterior or carinal
end of the shell. Hence, we may safely infer, that this
latter valve, which, though very much more developed on
one than on the other side, is so far medial as to curl round
and cover the line of opening between the moveable and
fixed tergum, is really a carina. The sixth valve differs
only very slightly in shape from the carina, and is directly
opposed to it; therefore, in accordance with all analogy, it
must be the rostrum. Consequently, the shell in <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>
consists of a moveable scutum and tergum, a fixed scutum
and tergum, a carina and rostrum, and, as we shall immediately
see, a membranous basis—the basis being, as in all
sessile cirripedes, the homologue of the peduncle in the
Lepadidæ.</p>

<p>The moveable scutum and tergum stand at about right
angles with the fixed pair; and as these latter form a part
of the wall of the shell, which is always steep on this side,
the moveable pair, which close the orifice, are nearly horizontal
or parallel to the basis and surface of attachment.
Hence, the animal's body, which is attached between the
two scuta, but nearest to the moveable scutum, also, lies
nearly parallel to the surface of attachment; and I was
consequently at first led to suspect that the basal membrane
was one side of the shell in a modified condition;
but the presence of the prehensile antennæ of the pupa in
nearly the middle of this membrane, and the sheet of
cement-tissue on its under side, demonstrate that this mem<a name="Page_499" id="Page_499" href="#Page_499"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 499]</span></a>brane,
though lying on one side of the animal, is the true
basis. To make all the parts in <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> hold the same position
as in other cirripedes, relatively to the surface of attachment,
we must develope the carina and rostrum equally on
both sides of the true longitudinal axis of the shell, and insert
the newly-developed portion between the basis and the fixed
scutum and tergum, reducing the latter in size, and tilting
a little up the moveable scutum and tergum; and by this
means the animal's body would be turned, so that its dorso-ventral
longitudinal plane would stand at right angles to
the basal membrane.</p>

<p>Extraordinarily great as is the difference between the
right and left sides of the whole shell, yet in all the species
it seems to be entirely a matter of chance whether it be the
right scutum and tergum with the right side of the rostrum
and carina, or the left scutum and tergum with the left side of
the rostrum and carina, which become abnormally developed.
Nor does there seem to be any relation between the side
of the operculum to be attached, whether right or left, and
the nature of the surface of attachment; for I have seen
many specimens adhering to perfectly level surfaces, and to
quite cylindrical branches of Laminariæ; and in these cases,
however the larva might attach itself, there could be nothing
to favour the development of one side more than the other.
Although the attached scuta and terga are larger than the
moveable pair, yet, owing to the small development of the
carina and rostrum on the attached side, the upper or unattached
side must be considered as the most developed. In
this respect, and in the circumstance of either right or left
side being modified, we are reminded of the structure of
<i>Pœcilasma Kæmpferi</i> (described in my former volume on
the Lepadidæ), in which the valves on the side of the capitulum,
nearest to the crab's body, to which the specimens
were attached, were somewhat less developed than those on
the opposite side. I may add, that in ordinary Crustaceans,
as I am informed by Professor Bell, the unequal development
of the thoracic limbs seems quite capriciously to affect
either the left or right side of the body.</p>

<p><i>General Appearance of the Shell.</i>—The shell is in most
cases much depressed and irregularly circular; the side formed<a name="Page_500" id="Page_500" href="#Page_500"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 500]</span></a>
by the fixed scutum and tergum is always steeper than
the other side: the colour is white or pale brownish, and in
<a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a> pale red. The surface is naked. The size is small,
rarely exceeding a quarter of an inch in diameter, and the
whole shell often appears like a mere scale on the surface of
attachment. The most remarkable feature in the external
aspect is due to the suture between the rostrum and carina,
which is formed by oblique, interlocking plates or folds; as
all these plates continue to be added to at their extremities
during growth, the upper plates become longer than the
lower ones; and the plates on both sides of the suture
together form a triangular area, with the broad end uppermost,
somewhat like the radius of a sessile cirripede: they
act, also, like a radius, for their growth serves to separate
these two valves, and so adds to the diameter of the shell.
The suture between the rostrum and fixed scutum and that
between the carina and fixed tergum are nearly of the same
nature, but the former is more conspicuous than the latter;
neither are so conspicuous as that between the carina and
rostrum: accordingly as the right or left scutum and tergum
are moveable, so the suture, second in plainness, (see
Pl. <a href="#Page_705">21</a>, fig. <a href="#p21f01a">1 <i>a</i></a>, and <a href="#p21f01d">1 <i>d</i></a>,) is placed to the left or right
hand. The fourth suture, between the fixed scutum and
tergum, as viewed externally, is straight, and so very obscure
that it has been overlooked by some authors, and the
shell described as consisting of only three nearly equal
pieces, for the fixed scutum and tergum together are about
equal in size to the carina or rostrum. The orifice approaches
more nearly to an unequal-sided triangle, with
the apex broadly truncated, than to any other figure.
The operculum fits with remarkable closeness, and is surrounded
by a slight rim, formed by the edges of the four
other valves.</p>

<p><i>Moveable Scutum and Tergum.</i>—The scutum (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> in <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a> and <a href="#p21f05">5</a>)
is narrow and very small, barely equalling half the size of
the tergum, and therefore proportionally much smaller than
in any other cirripede; in a very young shell, however, (of
<a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>) less than a pin's head in size, the scutum equalled
the tergum in size. The valve is remarkably thick; it is
generally depressed down the middle; but in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501" href="#Page_501"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 501]</span></a>
this part is longitudinally ribbed. The occludent margin
is curved. On the tergal margin there are two articular
ridges (with a deepish furrow between them), of which the
upper one (′ in <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, in fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>, and <a href="#p21f05">5</a>) extends from the apex
about half-way down the valve; and the other, or lower
articular ridge (′′ in <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>), generally runs down nearly to the
basal margin: an angle, running from the apex to the
basi-tergal corner of the valve, appears like a third articular
ridge, but cannot properly be considered such. The above
two articular ridges interfold with analogous ones on the
scutal margin of the tergum, and so lock the valves together.
On the under side (fig. <a href="#p21f01f">1 <i>f</i></a>), the surface is bounded along
the occludent margin by a slight rim: there is generally
a very slight depression for the adductor muscle; but in
<a href="#Verruca_Spengleri"><i>V. Spengleri</i></a> there is a straight, short, sharp (Pl. <a href="#Page_705">21</a>, fig. <a href="#p21f02">2</a>),
prominent adductor ridge.</p>

<p>The <i>moveable tergum</i> is broad and rhomboidal. Externally
a prominent axial ridge (′′′ in T, in fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>, &amp;c.), which
widens downwards, runs from the apex of the valve to the
basal point, and there projecting slightly, causes the scutum
to be indented; this indentation on the scutum appears like
a third articular ridge, lying beneath (′′), <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, in fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>, &amp;c.
Above the lower and axial ridge, on the scutal margin of
the tergum, there is a middle articular ridge, which locks in,
between the lower (′′) and upper articular ridges (′) of the
scutum (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>). Again above the middle ridge there is an
upper and third articular ridge (′), which is either quite distinct,
as in fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, or more commonly is formed by the
occludent margin of the valve, as in <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>. The
broad extremity of this upper articular ridge is often produced
into a slight projection, or shoulder, and this always
underlies the scutum, of which the under and upper surface
is indented or furrowed (see fig. <a href="#p21f01f">1 <i>f</i></a>), in order to receive
this shoulder. The upper articular ridge of the
scutum (′, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>) locks in between the upper articular ridge
or occludent margin (′, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>), and the middle ridge (′′, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>) of
the tergum.</p>

<p>Hence, altogether, there are three articular ridges on the
scutal margin of the tergum, the occludent margin being generally
counted as one; whereas, on the tergal margin of the<a name="Page_502" id="Page_502" href="#Page_502"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 502]</span></a>
scutum, there are only two ridges, though, as before noticed,
an outer indentation, which is developed as a ridge in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V.
nexa</i></a> (fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>), might almost be counted as a third articular
ridge.</p>

<p>I may here just remark, that the furrow between the two
ridges on the tergal margin of the scutum, resembles the
articular furrow in the scutum of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>; but it may
be doubted whether the resemblance be more than superficial,
as this furrow, in the case of <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, receives the
edge itself of the tergum, whereas here it receives only a
ridge, proceeding from the apex of the tergum, to a nearly
middle point on its scutal margin. Finally, I may add,
that the tergum in this genus, in general shape, in growth
(presently to be referred to), in the manner in which the
upper scutal shoulder is overlapped by the scutum, and in
the presence of the axial ridge, presents a very striking resemblance
to certain old fossil species of Pollicipes, and to
a limited extent to the living species of Lithotrya.</p>

<p>The scutum and tergum being interlocked, move together;
they can be firmly shut by the contraction of the
long adductor scutorum muscle. Their opening appears
partly due to the elasticity of the membranous hinge (representing
the opercular membrane), by which they are
attached transversely, just beneath the summit of the carina
and rostrum. No doubt the protrusion of the cirri effectively
aids the act of opening. These valves are not capable
(nor, of course, the other valves) of any other movement;
for there are no muscles for such movements.</p>

<p><i>Fixed Scutum and Tergum.</i>—The fixed scutum is larger
than the fixed tergum, and therefore has the same proportions
as the homologous valves in ordinary cirripedia, but
reversed proportions compared with the moveable scutum
and tergum. The shape of neither valve can hardly be
described. The <i>fixed Scutum</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span> in all the figs.), externally,
seems at first to consist of two portions, namely, a curved
occludent rim (<i>a</i>), closely resembling the opposed occludent
margin (<i>a</i>) of the moveable scutum (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>), having in fact undergone
very little modification, (as may be best seen in Pl. <a href="#Page_705">21</a>,
fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>); and secondly, of a much modified portion (marked
′′), which resembles in outline and state of surface the rest<a name="Page_503" id="Page_503" href="#Page_503"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 503]</span></a>
of the walls of the shell, and may be called the parietal
portion. The rostrum (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>) curls round the end of the occludent
portion, under an edge (<i>b</i>), evidently answering to the
basal margin (<i>b</i>) of the moveable scutum, and is simply
united to this portion by membrane, but beyond this part,
it is articulated to the parietal portion (′′) of the fixed scutum,
by oblique interlocking ridges, like those forming the suture
between the rostrum and carina. In <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>, however,
(fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>)
the rostrum (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>) does not curl round any part of the
interlocking fixed scutum (<span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span>), but articulates with it by a
straight suture. Internally, the fixed scutum (<span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span> in figs. <a href="#p21f01e">1 <i>e</i></a>, <a href="#p21f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>,
of reversed shells) has a surprisingly large, thin adductor plate
(<i>m</i> in fig. <a href="#p21f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>, <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), with a rounded outline, projecting nearly
parallel to the basis or surface of attachment; the adductor
scutorum muscle is attached to its upper surface, and consequently
the animal's body lies between this plate and the
moveable scutum. In the fixed scutum of <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>, however,
there is a deep pit, instead of a plate, for this muscle.</p>

<p>The <i>fixed Tergum</i>, likewise, consists of two portions—a
middle and lower, or parietal portion, and a rim or upper
portion; the rim consists of two unequal arms, answering
to the two upper margins (not merely the edges) of the rhomboidal
moveable tergum; the longer rim (<i>x</i> in <span class="smcap lowercase">T′</span>, see fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>)
answers to the carinal margin (<i>x</i>) of the moveable tergum,
and may be called the carinal rim; and the shorter rim
(<i>o</i> and ′ in fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>) answers to the occludent margin (<i>o</i> and ′) of
the moveable valve, and may be called the occludent rim.
The carina curls round the end of the carinal rim, under an
edge, <i>z</i> (much <span class="correction" title="In the original book: fore-shortened">foreshortened</span> in <span class="smcap lowercase">T′</span> in fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>, and best
seen in fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>), answering to at least a large part of the basal
margin (<i>z</i>) of the moveable tergum, and interlocks, by a serrated
suture, with the edge of the parietal portion of the
valve. Internally (fig. <a href="#p21f01e">1 <i>e</i></a>, less plain in <a href="#p21f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>) there is a transverse
ledge, notched in the middle, and sometimes deeply
hollow beneath, running across the valve in about the line
of the adductor plate of the fixed scutum: this ledge, in fact,
marks and is partly caused by, the line of separation between
the central or parietal, much modified, and the scarcely
modified, upper or rim portion of the valve. The use of this
ledge is apparently to give attachment, as does the under<a name="Page_504" id="Page_504" href="#Page_504"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 504]</span></a>
side of the adductor plate of the fixed scutum, to ligamentous
fibres, presently to be mentioned, by which the
shell is attached to the basal membrane: the carina and
rostrum being so much more gently inclined, do not stand
in need of a ledge for their attachment.</p>

<p>By comparing the moveable scutum and tergum with the
corresponding fixed valves, in all the species, the modification
of the latter may be clearly made out to have been effected
as follows; and the case appears to me a striking and interesting
one. The moveable scutum and tergum lie in the
same plane, and are articulated by the means of three ridges
on the tergum (including the occludent margin), and by two
on the scutum. The fixed scutum and tergum have to be
curved, and to be greatly increased in size; and this is
brought about, as we shall see, by the large development of
a certain small portion of each valve. Comparing first the
moveable tergum (<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>) with the fixed tergum (<span class="smcap lowercase">T′</span>), the umbo
of growth matches the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: umbo:">umbo</span> of the four margins of the
moveable valve, the carinal (<i>x</i>), basal (<i>z</i>), and occludent
(<i>o</i> in fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>), margins can be identified with certainty in the
fixed valve, from their close similarity in shape, their absolute
apposition, or correspondence in position. There
remains only the scutal or articular margin, with its three
articular ridges; of these, the uppermost (′), inasmuch as
in most of the species it is hardly distinct from the occludent
margin, can, as we have just seen, be clearly
identified, and is overlapped, as it normally should be, by
the upper tergal corner of the fixed scutum: the second or
middle articular ridge, though not so distinct as in the
moveable valves, can be plainly recognised (′′), <span class="smcap lowercase">T′</span>, in fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>,
and <a href="#p21f05">5</a>; and it serves its normal function of articulating the
two valves together. But when we look in the fixed valve
for the third or axial ridge (′′′), we find in its exact place,
namely, extending from the umbo to the extreme opposite
end of the valve, between the second articular ridge (′′) and
the basal margin (<i>z</i>, see fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>), only that portion of the valve
which I have called the parietal portion; consequently, I do
not doubt that this really is the axial ridge largely expanded.
So again in comparing the moveable scutum (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>) with the fixed
scutum (<span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span>); two of the three margins of the former, namely,<a name="Page_505" id="Page_505" href="#Page_505"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 505]</span></a>
the occludent (<i>a</i>, see fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i>)</a> and basal (<i>b</i>), can be identified
without a doubt in the fixed valve: the third and tergal
margin remains; this should have two articular ridges; of
these the upper one, still serving its normal function, can
be detected in all the species (′ in fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>), and can be seen
pretty plainly (′ fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>) in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>: but of the lower and
other articular ridge there is no sign,—excepting indeed the
whole parietal portion of the valve, which, from holding an
exactly homologous position with the lower articular ridge
of the moveable valve, I cannot doubt in this ridge expanded
and curiously metamorphosed. Hence, in both fixed scutum
and tergum, it is the outermost or lowest of the articular
ridges which has been modified and expanded, so as to rest on
and be fixed to the surface of attachment. It would appear
as if it had resulted from one ridge in each of these valves
having been thus used up by expansion (so to express myself),
that the suture between the fixed scutum and tergum
is more simple than any other suture in the whole shell;
and it is owing probably to this straightness, and consequent
<em>tendency</em> to weakness, that the valves do not grow
along this line, and so do not become separated from each
other during growth, as on the three other lines of suture.
As it actually is, owing to this suture never being separated,
it is even stronger than the others; its edges on the inside
(fig. <a href="#p21f01c">1 <i>c</i></a>), I may add, are a little inflected or prominent.</p>

<p><i>Rostrum</i> and <i>Carina</i>: these valves differ from each other,
only in the former (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>) being rather the largest, and in being
more plainly articulated with the fixed scutum, than is the
carina (<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>) with the fixed tergum. Their umbones stand in
their normal places, at the two ends of the orifice leading
into the sack, that is, facing the dorso-ventral longitudinal
plane of the animal; but they are very unequally developed
on the two sides, and hence they rise very obliquely from the
surface of attachment. Their summits are nearly square,
which is caused by the continued growth on both sides of the
oblique plates or ridges, by which they are articulated with
the adjoining valves. These plates strikingly resemble, as
already stated, the radii in certain species of <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>.
Without these articulating plates, the outline of the rostrum
and carina would have been triangular, with the apex up<a name="Page_506" id="Page_506" href="#Page_506"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 506]</span></a>wards.
In <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>, in which the walls of the shell are
almost perpendicular, the rostrum (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>) is very peculiar
and patelliformed, with the umbo sub-central: this results
from the development of a border at the upper end of the
valve. In this same species, the basal edges of the rostrum,
carina, fixed scutum and tergum, are rectangularly inflected,
so as to form a ledge round the basis, as in the case of some
few species of <a href="#Genus_Chthamalus">Chthamalus</a>,—the ledge appearing like part
of the real basis. During the growth of the shell, the upper
internal ends of the carina and rostrum are either rendered
solid, or a ledge is formed on the inside across their summits,
hollow beneath, like the sheath of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, to which
solid or hollow ledge the basal margins of the moveable
scutum and tergum are attached by a rim of membrane,
forming a hinge.</p>

<p><i>Direction of Growth: Minute Structure of Valves.</i>—The
shell grows downwards all round its basal margin. As
far as the diametric growth of its upper part is concerned,
there may be said to be only three valves, for the
fixed scutum and tergum never become, as already stated,
separated; on the three other lines of suture, the valves
are added to on both sides; and thus the whole upper
part of the shell, and the orifice, increases in diameter.
The moveable scutum and tergum grow along their basal
margins, and along the margins by which they are articulated
together; but the scutum in this latter respect,
less than the tergum. The summits of the moveable scutum
and tergum, during continued growth, become either worn
away, or they project freely; in this latter case, an internal
ledge is added round the upper end of the fixed scutum and
tergum, so as to keep the orifice accurately closed. In
<a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a> the rostrum, with its sub-central umbo, is anomalous,
as already stated, owing to a broad upper internal
border growing in a direction almost directly opposed to the
basal growth of the moveable opercular valves.</p>

<p>In young specimens, on the apices of both scuta and both
terga, and on the carina, but not on the rostrum, <em>primordial
valves</em> may be distinguished, resembling the valves, so
called, which first appear (p. <a href="#Page_129">129</a>, <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>) after the
metamorphosis in, the Lepadidæ. In the <a href="#Family_Verrucidae">Verrucidæ</a>, how<a name="Page_507" id="Page_507" href="#Page_507"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 507]</span></a>ever,
they are calcareous; and the minute transverse cylinders,
of which they appear to be composed, stand further apart,
causing the surface of the primordial valve to be marked
with little separate circles, instead of by hexagons.</p>

<p>The shelly matter of which the valves are composed is
translucent: it is remarkably destitute of any investing
membrane. The under surface is marked with rows of
minute approximate pores, parallel to the lines of growth,
into which the corium enters: after a portion of shell has been
dissolved in acid, these threads of corium are seen to change,
a short distance within, into cylinders of yellow chitine,
running obliquely through the substance of the valve.
These cylinders are about 1/2000th of an inch in diameter, but
in parts they are spindle-shaped and twice as thick: they
vary in length, about 1/100th of an inch being the average
length: these cylinders at their upper ends suddenly contract
into a point, more or less long, or are produced into
a very fine tortuous tubulus of chitine, imbedded in the
shell: I have seen in no other Cirripedes tubuli of this
structure. There are other ordinary tubuli, such as occur
in the valves of most Cirripedes, about 1/6000th of an inch
in diameter, and which sometimes alternate with the above-described
thicker cylinders. There are no external spines.
From the number and length of the tubuli of both kinds,
the tissue left after the action of acid is singularly complicated.</p>

<p><i>Basis.</i>—The basal membrane is thin, and is divided, but
not very plainly, into concentric slips, marking the successive
increments of growth. In the middle of it, in two young
specimens, I found with great difficulty the pupal prehensile
antennæ: they were of small size, measuring from the extreme
edge of the main or second segment to the end of the
disc, only 27/6000ths of an inch: the disc appeared narrow (as in
Pollicipes and Scalpellum), with a single spine at the proximate
end: the ultimate segment, placed as usual at about
right angles to the disc, bore two groups of shorter and longer
spines, but I could not count how many. The antennæ were
enveloped in a mass of cement of a yellow colour, resembling
in all its characters the cement of other Cirripedes. In only
one case, I believe I saw bifurcating cement-ducts, of extreme<a name="Page_508" id="Page_508" href="#Page_508"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 508]</span></a>
tenuity, viz. 1/15,000th of an inch in diameter. The sheet of
cement on the whole under side of the basal membrane, not
rarely shows a very irregular reticulated structure. For
convenience sake, it will be best to defer the discussion on
the very anomalous, though slight, powers of excavation which
this genus possesses, and which I must attribute to the
effects of some substance secreted probably by the cement-organs.
I will here only mention, that the specimens which
have excavated a depression, are less firmly attached than
those, which have not acted on their support; and that, in
the former case, the basal membrane, for a considerable
space in the middle, becomes quite detached.</p>

<p><i>Animal's Body.</i>—The body is much flattened and, owing
to the little development of one side of the shell, lies parallel
to the surface of attachment. The prosoma is but little
protuberant. The articulations of the thorax are unusually
straight and transverse. The <i>Mouth</i> is also much flattened:
it is placed rather distantly from the adductor scutorum
muscle, owing to the production of the lower margin of the
labrum. The <i>Labrum</i> is not notched, or even hollowed out
in the middle, or (excepting in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>) bullate; its crest is
surmounted by about eight (more numerous in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>) little
teeth, or by some fine bristles. The <i>Palpi</i> are of moderate
size, with their tips nearly meeting; they are slightly curved,
and have bristles only on their outer sides and extremities:
they are apparently capable of being lifted up and down by a
muscle attached to them, just outside the rounded swelling on
each side of the labrum to which they are articulated: in
<a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>, however, the palpi are very small and narrow, and
their tips do not nearly meet. In this genus, therefore, we find
the swollen state of the labrum and the size of the palpi—characters
generally invariable and of high classificatory importance—variable.
The mandibles have three upper main
teeth, with two or three minute lower teeth, or, in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>,
with the lower part pectinated with small spines: in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V.
Strömia</i></a>, I have seen traces of the second tooth being laterally
double—a character of some importance. The <i>Maxillæ</i> have
a notch under the upper pair of large spines, with the lower
part bearing, as usual, a double row of bristles, and forming
a large step-formed projection: these organs are furnished<a name="Page_509" id="Page_509" href="#Page_509"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 509]</span></a>
with the usual apodeme and muscles. The <i>Outer Maxillæ</i>
are prominent, and deeply lobed on their inner surfaces,
the two lobes being clothed with bristles.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—The first pair are attached, as usual, on each side
of the mouth, and stand some way apart from the five posterior
pairs. The second and third pairs differ considerably
in structure from the three posterior pairs, which are much
elongated. The <i>first pair</i> (excepting in <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>) is short,
with the two rami slightly unequal in length, and with the
segments thickly clothed, as usual, with spines. The <em>second
pair</em> is remarkable from the posterior ramus being more
than twice as long, and containing thrice as many segments,
as the anterior ramus, which is barely as long as the shorter
ramus of the first pair: the segments in the anterior ramus
of the second pair (only five in number in a full-sized specimen)
are broader and more protuberant in front, and more
thickly clothed with spines (the terminal spines being doubly
pectinated), than are the segments on the posterior ramus;
on the latter, the uppermost segments have their bristles
arranged in front in simple pairs, with the dorsal spines
long, the lower segments being more thickly clothed with
bristles, owing to the development of lateral rows. The
<i>third pair</i> resembles in every respect the second pair, except
in being a little longer, and in the bristles on the posterior
ramus being less crowded, more resembling the arrangement
of those on the posterior cirri. In <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>, however,
there is not so great an inequality in length or dissimilarity
in structure in the two rami of the second cirrus, and
only a very slight difference of any kind in the two rami of
the third pair. <i>Fourth</i>, <i>fifth</i>, and <i>sixth pairs</i> have numerous
elongated segments, bearing four or three pairs of long
slender spines in front, with a single minute bristle between
each pair, and with two or three slender spines in the dorsal
tuft.</p>

<p>There is a considerable amount of variation in the proportional
length, and in the number of the segments, of
the several cirri in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>; in some specimens the two
rami of the fourth pair were unequal in length; in some,
nearly all the cirri on the lower or attached side were shorter
than those on the upper side.</p>

<p><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510" href="#Page_510"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 510]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Caudal Appendages.</i>—These are of most unusual length,
sometimes even exceeding those of <i>Ibla quadrivalvis</i>, which
surpasses, in this respect, all other cirripedes. They
arise on each side and over the anus. They consist of
numerous (sometimes as many as twenty-four), unequal,
cylindrical, thin segments, bearing, at their upper ends, a
circle of long and very slender spines. They sometimes equal
two thirds or even four fifths of the length of the sixth cirrus;
but their length, and the number of their segments, (sometimes
imperfectly divided), varies much in different specimens
of the same species, and sometimes even on opposite
sides of the same individual. In some very young shells,
as big as a pin's head, the caudal appendages were proportionally
extremely short, and consisted of only two or
three segments. No muscles enter these organs; and when
the animal is taken out of its sack, they project straight out
behind, instead of being curled in, like the cirri.</p>

<p><i>Anatomical Structure.</i>—The animal's body is attached to
the two scuta by the adductor scutorum, and by the other
usual muscles running towards the mouth, and surrounding
the prosoma. The whole external covering or shell has no
other muscles; <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> thus differing from the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a> and
Lepadidæ; but the shell is attached all round, near its circumference,
to the basal membrane, by a band of very short
fibres, appearing like muscles, but really ligamentous, as
determined for me by Professor Quekett. <i>Branchiæ</i> are
entirely absent. The <i>alimentary canal</i> presents all the
usual characters, but in the prosoma is rather abruptly
bent back on itself. The orifices of the two <i>olfactory
pouches</i> are not at all prominent; they are placed directly
under the outer maxillæ, (homologically in their middle
segment), just above a small, medial, tongue-like apodeme.
The orifices of the <i>acoustic sacks</i> appeared to be in
their usual position beneath the basal articulations of
the first pair of cirri. The <i>vesiculæ seminales</i> occupy
their usual position in the prosoma; they are not much
convoluted; they unite before entering the penis. The
probosciformed penis is imperfectly ringed; it is thick and
short, and tapers much more abruptly than is usual; it
supports a few very thin hairs. The <i>ovarian cæca</i> are<a name="Page_511" id="Page_511" href="#Page_511"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 511]</span></a>
spread over the basal membrane, at the bottom of the
sack; hence they in fact lie almost on one side of the
animal: they consist of two main trunks, proceeding out of
the animal's body at the rostral end of the sack, which then
branch and inosculate. In specimens of <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a> collected
by Mr. Peach for me, in Cornwall, during the first
week of April, there were included two ovigerous lamellæ,
placed transversely across the rostral and the carinal end
of the sack: the lamellæ were .11 of an inch in length;
they appeared loose and not attached, as in the Lepadidæ,
to any ovigerous fræna. The ova, in their earliest age,
have one end much pointed, and are 8/1000ths of an inch in
length; they become blunter and increase a little in size
before the larvæ burst forth. The larvæ, both during their
earliest stage and after the first moult, have been excellently
figured and described<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[137]</span></a> by Mr. C. Spence Bate: they
present no particular characters distinct from the larvæ of
other Cirripedes. I will only further add, that the structure
of the prehensile antennæ still adherent to the basal
membrane, indicates that the larva in its last stage,—that
is the locomotive pupa,—has a normal character.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—These have been sufficiently discussed under
the family; I need here only remark that all the species,
with the exception of <a href="#Verruca_nexa"><i>V. nexa</i></a>, are intimately allied together.</p>

<p><i>Range—Habits—Geological History.</i>—The genus
<a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> ranges, being represented by four species, from
Iceland to Cape Horn. The species that is found in Tierra
del Fuego extends up the west coast to Peru. Our northern
form, <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>, (if I may trust a specimen in the British
Museum, apparently ticketed in an authentic manner), occurs
also in the Red Sea; and this is the only locality in the
eastern hemisphere whence I have seen this genus. The
species seem generally to live in rather deep water: I procured
<a href="#Verruca_laevigata"><i>V. lævigata</i></a> from nineteen fathoms, on the east coast
of Patagonia: <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a> is found, according to information
given me by Professor Forbes, on the British shores,
between five and fifty fathoms, and on the steep shore off
Mull, in ninety fathoms; but Mr. Thompson assures me<a name="Page_512" id="Page_512" href="#Page_512"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 512]</span></a>
that he once saw it adhering to tidal rocks and likewise
to some floating bark. Generally the species are
attached to living organic bodies, especially shells of
Mollusca and of Cirripedes, to Gorgoniæ, and Laminariæ;
less frequently to rocks. We shall immediately see that it
has slight powers of excavation. This genus is geologically
older than any true sessile cirripede or member of the
<a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>: <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a> is found in the Glacial Deposits and
in the Red and Coralline Crag of England: another species
(in a state not to be identified) occurs in the ancient Tertiary
formations of Patagonia; and another in the Chalk of
England and Belgium. The fact of this Family ascending
to a Secondary epoch accords, in an interesting manner,
with its affinities; inasmuch as though in appearance a
sessile cirripede, it is almost equally related to the Lepadidæ
and <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, and is more nearly related to the
Lepadidæ than to the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, or typical members of the
<a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>: of the latter, none have hitherto been found in
any Secondary deposit, whereas the Lepadidæ culminated
during the Cretacean period.</p>


<h3><a name="Genus_Verruca_Powers_of_Excavation" /><i>Powers of Excavation.</i></h3>

<p>My attention was called to this subject by Mr. Hancock,
whose excellent researches on the boring of Mollusca are
well known. <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>Verruca Strömia</i></a>, when attached to shells
destitute of an epidermis, excavates, as he informed me, a
slight depression, deepest in the middle; but when the
epidermis is present no effect whatever is produced. We
shall presently see that the central depression is in some
degree distinct from that of the circumference. I have
since found Mr. Hancock's observations strictly applicable
to <a href="#Verruca_laevigata"><i>V. lævigata</i></a>, <a href="#Verruca_Spengleri"><i>V. Spengleri</i></a>, and to an ancient tertiary
species from Patagonia. From having found that the
following cirripedes, viz., Lithotrya, <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>,
all form their deep excavations by mechanical
means, and from having read the above-mentioned memoirs
by Mr. Hancock on the boring of mollusca, I was strongly
impressed with the idea that the action in <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> would
likewise prove mechanical: but from the following facts I<a name="Page_513" id="Page_513" href="#Page_513"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 513]</span></a>
have come to the conclusion that the excavation must be due
to a solvent, probably poured out from the cement-ducts,
which debouch on the under side of the basal membrane.</p>

<p>In the first place, an epidermis, as just stated, perfectly
preserves the shells of the various species of mollusca and
certain cirripedes, to which I have seen <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> attached:
this is well shown by comparing the effect produced on the
same shell in parts covered by the epidermis and in parts
whence it has been abraded; or where the shell of the
<a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> had fixed itself, whilst very young, within a crack
in the epidermis, and had subsequently, by its growth,
turned up the edges, and had then acted on the underlying
shell; whereas the specimens attached to the sound epidermis
had not produced the smallest effect. Again, I
have seen an epidermis-covered mussel-shell encrusted by a
hard nullipora, on which <a href="#Verruca_laevigata"><i>V. lævigata</i></a> was attached; and
here the calcareous nullipora, under the middle of the
basal membrane, was entirely corroded away, whilst the
underlying epidermis and the shell beneath it, were not in
the least affected. The protection afforded by the epidermis
is still more strikingly shown by contrasting shells
with very sharp prominent ridges, when thus invested and
when naked, to which Verrucæ have been attached: I have
given a figure (Pl. <a href="#Page_705">21</a>, fig. <a href="#p21f06">6</a>) of a piece of an invested
Venus, from the surface of which a <a href="#Verruca_Spengleri"><i>V. Spengleri</i></a> had been
just removed; on the other hand, I have seen a Peruvian
Discina in which even sharper ridges, covered by epidermis,
were left absolutely untouched, although projecting
deeply into the shell of an attached <a href="#Verruca_laevigata"><i>V. lævigata</i></a>.
I have seen several specimens of this latter <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> (which
has the power of corroding naked shell as deeply as its
congeners), attached to the membrane-covered variety of
<a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>Balanus lævis</i></a>, the shell of which was thus perfectly preserved:
now this membrane is little more than the 1/2000th of
an inch in thickness; it is not hard, and so brittle that it
generally separates with the <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>, leaving the underlying
shell of the <a href="#Balanus_laevis"><i>B. lævis</i></a> with its lines of growth glossy
and perfect: it appears to me impossible that a membrane
so thin and brittle could resist an action, if mechanical,
which has worn away from twenty to forty times as great a<a name="Page_514" id="Page_514" href="#Page_514"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 514]</span></a>
thickness of hard shell; but the thinnest film of any matter
on which acid does not act, as of grease in certain forms of
printing, will perfectly preserve the underlying substance,
and as I have ascertained by putting on a drop of acid, is
the case with this membrane. I have removed several
scores of shells of <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a> from the stems of Laminariæ,
and when the latter were washed and slightly dried, generally
not the least effect could be seen, except that the spots
where the shell had adhered were glossy from the still
adherent basal membrane: yet the stems of Laminariæ are
far from hard. In some cases, however, the attachment
of the <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> seemed to have produced a very slight
depression on the Laminaria, but this, I think, may be
safely attributed to the growth of the surrounding surface;
for I have seen exactly the same effect produced by
the attachment of the discs of the antennæ of a Lepas,
and these discs, with their long spines, could not possibly
produce any excavation; nor is Lepas or its pupa in any
case a burrowing animal. Again, I have seen a few
specimens of <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> attached to Gorgoniæ, and they had
not acted in the least on the horny axis. I have examined
numerous specimens of <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a> attached to three pieces
of slate-rock, and to one piece of red sandstone, all from
different localities, and no effect whatever had been produced;
yet the slate-rock, especially in one instance, was
soft. Mr. Bate, to whom I am indebted for some of these
specimens, also informs me that he could discover no impressions
on the slate-rocks, whence specimens of the
<a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> had been removed. On the other hand, I have
had two specimens of limestone, with attached Verrucæ,
one coarse and very impure, and the other hard and
marble-like; and in both cases there was a distinct central
slight cavity, including loose gritty matter. The loose particles
evidently resulted from the unequal action either of
a solvent or of some mechanical power on the rock, for it is
improbable in the highest degree that the shells should have
fixed themselves exactly over small collections of loose particles,
even if such could possibly have remained on projecting
surfaces of sea-washed rocks.</p>

<p>The above facts seem to indicate pretty plainly that the<a name="Page_515" id="Page_515" href="#Page_515"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 515]</span></a>
excavation of the support does not depend on its hardness,
but on its containing calcareous matter, liable to be acted
on by some solvent: but as this view, considering what we
know of Lithotrya and of the two other burrowing genera
of cirripedes to be hereafter described, appears improbable,
I will add a few additional observations. I most carefully
examined the shell and basal membrane of <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>, and likewise
the tissues left after the dissolution of the shell in acid,
and could detect no structure at all fitted for boring; and
what appears more important, there was no apparent difference
in the state of the specimens which had and had not
excavated a hollow; and this, I think, would certainly have
been the case (as in Lithotrya) if the action had been
mechanical. It is not easy to ascertain, owing to the
small effect at any time produced, at how early an age
<a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> begins to act on its support; but I found two sets
of specimens only 1/20th of an inch in basal diameter, which
had certainly commenced. The ribbed shell, (Pl. <a href="#Page_705">21</a>, fig. <a href="#p21f06">6</a>),
especially the middle rib, shows, in a somewhat exaggerated
degree, the <em>typical</em> form of the excavation; it may be here
seen that the excavation is of the same depth for some
little distance from the circumference towards the centre,
but that in the middle it suddenly becomes deeper. I
have seen several specimens with a central hollow, without
any, or with scarcely any, marginal depression, and
likewise the reversed case. These several facts show that
the central excavation cannot be due to an equable action,
prolonged during the whole growth of the shell, having
thus affected the middle more than the circumferential
parts, for in this case the excavations would have sloped
into each other. In specimens which have not at all acted
on their support, the whole basal membrane is firmly attached,
as in all ordinary cirripedes, to the supporting surface; but
in those which have acted, the middle portion of the basal
membrane is quite unattached, and the circumferential
portion is, I think, less firmly attached than is usual; but
between these two portions, there is a circular zone strongly
cemented to the supporting surface, and which alone keeps
the shell in its place. Now, on the mechanical theory, to
account for the circumferential hollow, the basal edges of<a name="Page_516" id="Page_516" href="#Page_516"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 516]</span></a>
the shell together with the circumference of the basal
membrane must be subjected to movement, but the shell
is united to the basal membrane by corium and by transparent
structureless chitine (both of which may be left
out of question) and by a circle of short fibres, which
adhere at their lower ends to the firmly cemented circular
zone, and by their upper ends to the shell; and these fibres
have been very carefully examined by Professor Quekett,
and pronounced to be not muscular, but exclusively ligamentous,
and therefore incapable of moving the edge of
the shell. The basal membrane over the central hollow is,
as stated, quite loose: its lower surface, formed by a reticulated
layer of horny cement-tissue, shows no signs of
abrasion, and the membrane is so brittle and tender, that
in specimens which have been once dried and then well
soaked, it almost invariably cracks when the shell is removed,
owing to its mere adhesion to the delicate inner
tunics of the sack; yet on the mechanical theory, the
wearing of the central hollow must have been caused by the
action of this middle portion of the basal membrane,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[138]</span></a>
which, it may be repeated, is destitute of muscles. From
the presence of the prehensile pupal antennæ, enveloped
in cement, nearly in the centre of the basal membrane,
it is certain that this spot was originally attached to the
supporting surface, and has since been detached from it;
as, moreover, the central hollow goes on increasing in
diameter with the growth of the shell, it is certain that the
inner edge of the firmly attached circular zone of basal
membrane must likewise continually go on becoming detached:
it may, then, be asked by what force can the basal
membrane, seeing that it is united to its own shell above
only by fibres of ligament near the circumference, be continually
torn away from the underlying support, to which<a name="Page_517" id="Page_517" href="#Page_517"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 517]</span></a>
it is strongly cemented? On the other hand, on the
theory of a solvent slowly poured out from the cement-ducts,
its separation from its support is simply explained.
It might be supposed that the calcareous matter, when
dissolved, would not be able to escape from the central
hollow, owing to the basal membrane being so firmly
cemented all round it; but the attachment is by a
reticulated layer of cement; and I infer that it must be
permeated by open passages, from the fact of the hollow
being often filled, in dried specimens, by a bubble of air,
instead of the basal membrane being pressed closely down
into the hollow, as would have been the case had the hollow
been hermetically sealed up. I have seen a few instances in
which the bottom of the central hollow was occupied, (as
was remarked to me by Mr. Hancock), by a little chalky and
gritty matter; and in the case of one of the specimens of
calcareous rock, before alluded to, by coarse grains and
oxide of iron; this seems quite compatible with a solvent
acting more readily on certain parts of the rock or shell
than on other and less soluble parts or particles.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_138_138" id="Footnote_138_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_138_138"><span class="label">[138]</span></a> Mr. Hancock suggests to me that the basal membrane, on the mechanical
theory, need not itself move; the motion of epithelial scales, were they transferred
into cutting agents, might be supposed to be sufficient. But of such
scales, though I used very high powers, I could see no trace; and their presence
on the under side of the layer of cement seems hardly possible. Moreover,
according to Von Siebold ('Anatomie Comparée,' tom. 1, p. 412), ciliary
action has not been observed in any Crustacean, or indeed any Articulate animal.
This same statement is likewise made in Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist. 1854,
p. 136, by Dr. T. Williams.</p></div>

<p>The greatest depth of the central hollow, in any specimen
seen by me, even measuring from the top of a rib in the
case of a ribbed shell, to the deepest point, was only 1/50th of
an inch; but considering how much depressed the shell of
<a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a> is, I have no doubt that this small gain of space is
of service to the animal: we must suppose the loose middle
portion of the basal membrane is stretched slightly, or splits
and is repaired, so as to fit the hollow. With respect to
the even much slighter circumferential excavation, it barely
equals in depth the thickness of the extreme edges of the
walls; it must, I presume, give strength to the shell when
<em>laterally</em> pushed; but it certainly appeared to me that the
individuals which had excavated a depression for themselves,
could be <span class="correction" title="In the original book: prised">pried</span> vertically up much more easily than those
which had not acted on their support. Finally, we must
suppose that the hypothetical solvent is poured out of the
cement-ducts at the extreme circumference of the basal
membrane, which is almost loose and destitute of cement,
so as to slightly corrode outwards and downwards the calcareous
support; the action here then stops, and this rim<a name="Page_518" id="Page_518" href="#Page_518"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 518]</span></a>
of basal membrane becomes, after a new rim has been
formed and as the shell grows outwards, firmly cemented
down to the now slightly excavated surface of attachment;
but during all the time the solvent goes on acting in the
middle, and continues, during the whole growth of the shell,
to encroach on and dissolve the supporting surface from
under the inner edges of the previously cemented down,
circular zone of basal membrane. I have discussed this
subject at considerable length, as it appears to me an
interesting one. In this case we have the action of ciliæ<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[139]</span></a>
and of respiratory currents, to which in the case of Mollusca
so much has been attributed, entirely eliminated. It is,
also, an interesting fact, that within the same Order we
should have some Cirripedes boring by simply mechanical
means, and others by a chemical solvent.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[140]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2">I have given so full a description of the genus that little
remains to be said under the species. Generally the whole
shell is covered (independently of the interfolding, oblique,
articulating plates) by narrow, longitudinal ridges or folds;
and by this character alone the ordinary variety of <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>
can be distinguished (as far as I have seen) from all the
other species. The shell is white or dirty yellowish-brown.
The scutum has the lower articular ridge on its tergal
margin very narrow (but somewhat variable in width), appearing
like a mere slight shoulder, against which the longitudinal
axial ridge of the tergum abuts: it is not half as
wide as the short, upper articular ridge. On the under
side there is a very slight depression for the adductor scutorum
muscle. There is considerable variation in the degree
to which the transverse ledge on the under side of the fixed
tergum projects, and therefore in the depth of the hollow
thus formed. The specimens with the right-side, and those
with the left-side opercular valves moveable, are apparently
about equally numerous.</p>

<p>The specimen in the British Museum, from the Red Sea,
was attached to a Gorgonia, and was in the same box with a
<a href="#Genus_Pyrgoma">Pyrgoma</a>—circumstances favouring the correctness of the<a name="Page_520" id="Page_520" href="#Page_520"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 520]</span></a>
locality—but I am much surprised from the general distribution
of the species, that <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a> should occur in so
distant and isolated an area. After careful examination, I
can discover no constant difference between the Red Sea
and British specimens.</p>

<p>The specimens from the Crag have not their moveable
opercular valves, which offer much more important diagnostic
characters than the shell; but as far as the latter is concerned,
no difference whatever can be perceived from <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V.

<p class="p2">I can point out no difference in the shell between this
species and <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>, excepting that its walls seem invariably
to be smooth, which is rarely the case with <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V.
Strömia</i></a>; perhaps also the oblique interfolding articular
plates between the several compartments are here more
prominent. It appears that specimens with the left side
uppermost, and therefore with the left opercular valves
moveable, are considerably more common than those with
the right valves moveable. The moveable scutum and
tergum are articulated together by much more prominent
articular ridges than in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>, and the two valves
together are broader in proportion to their height,—the
height being measured from the apex to the basal margin.
In the scutum the lower articular ridge is considerably
broader than the short upper ridge. In the tergum, the<a name="Page_521" id="Page_521" href="#Page_521"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 521]</span></a>
basi-carinal corner is more rectangular, and the whole valve
is nearly square: owing to the deep furrow receiving the
lower articular ridge of the scutum, the axial ridge of the
tergum is proportionally narrower but more prominent than
in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>; the uppermost ridge (formed by the occludent
margin of the valve) projects, especially when viewed
on the under side (fig. <a href="#p21f03b">3 <i>b</i></a>), as a moderately sharp point.</p>

<p>In the <i>mouth</i>, the lower teeth of the mandibles are more
distinct than in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>; the lower part of the edge of
the maxilla is very prominent. In the second and third
pairs of cirri the terminal spines on the shorter rami are
coarsely pectinated; on the sixth pair there are only three
pairs of main spines on each segment; but these several
points, according to the analogy of other species, I should
expect to be variable.</p>

<p>This species is alluded to by Bruguière, in the 'Encyclopédie
Méthodique,' but was confounded by him with the
<a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a> of Europe.</p>

<p class="p2">It would appear that the present species does not attain
quite so large a size as the more northern <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>; the
walls are not longitudinally ribbed as is usual with this
latter species. The proportional sizes of the compartments
seem to be somewhat different; the fixed scutum is either
equal to or even smaller than the fixed tergum, instead of
being larger, as in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>; but in young individuals
the proportions are reversed. In several specimens the fixed
scutum and tergum together were larger than the carina.
The rounded adductor plate of the fixed scutum is extremely
large. The lines of growth, especially on the moveable
opercular valves, are rather more plainly crenated than in
<a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>. In the moveable scutum the lower articular
ridge on the tergal margin varies a little in size, and is<a name="Page_522" id="Page_522" href="#Page_522"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 522]</span></a>
sometimes larger than in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a> (but never so large as
in <a href="#Verruca_laevigata"><i>V. lævigata</i></a>), and is placed more in the middle of the
tergal margin: but by far the most important character by
which this species can be distinguished from all the others,
is the presence, on the under side of the moveable scutum,
of a straight, prominent adductor ridge, which runs up to
and even under the apex of the valve, for it is there slightly
hollowed out. In the moveable tergum, owing to the
medial position of the lower articular ridge of the scutum,
the middle of the scutal margin is more hollowed out, and
the axial ridge narrower, than in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>.</p>

<p>In the animal's body the only difference which I could
perceive was that the shorter rami of the second and third
pairs of cirri were not so short, compared either to the other
cirri or to the longer rami of these same cirri. In the
second cirrus, in a moderately-sized specimen, the segments
were six and thirteen in number in the two rami,
and in the third cirrus, seven and fifteen.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the specimen in the British Museum
of <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>, from the Red Sea, I should have concluded,
from geographical considerations, that <a href="#Verruca_Spengleri"><i>V. Spengleri</i></a>
probably was the species found in the Mediterranean, and
noticed by Spengler ('Schriften der Berl. Gesell.,' 1 B.,
1780), as a small variety of the northern <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>; and
likewise that it was the <i>Creusia echinoides</i> of Risso ('Hist.
Nat. Product. de l'Europe,' tom. 4, p. 382, 1826), which
is certainly a <a href="#Genus_Verruca">Verruca</a>, but not described with sufficient
minuteness to be recognised.</p>

<div class="habitat">

<p class="p2"><i>Hab.</i>—West Indies, Mus. Brit.; attached to a Gorgonia.</p></div>


<p class="p2">This species differs considerably from all the others in
the genus. The shell is brownish-red, tinted yellow: it is<a name="Page_523" id="Page_523" href="#Page_523"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 523]</span></a>
not at all depressed like the former species, but the walls
are almost perpendicular or even overhang their bases, and
the summit of the shell consequently is broad. This form
may be in part, but only in part, due to the attachment on
the thin branches of the Gorgonia. The umbones of the compartments
are remarkably prominent and sharp. Although
the parietes are nearly smooth, yet from being so steep,
they are little seen, and owing to the very prominent but
rounded ribs by which the compartments and opercular
valves are articulated together, the whole shell has a
strongly ribbed appearance. The diameter of the largest
specimen was .2 of an inch.</p>

<p>The <i>rostrum</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, fig. <a href="#p21f05">5</a>) is patelliformed, with the umbo of
growth sub-central, but rather above the middle point;
hence this valve, differently from the carina, and differently
from the rostrum of the other species, grows not only at its
basal margin, and on both sides where opposed to the
carina and fixed scutum, but also along its upper margin
where opposed to the basal edges of the moveable scutum
and tergum: owing to the perpendicularity of this valve,
the upper part forms a ledge almost parallel to the orifice
of the shell. The carina (<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>) is of unusually small size, being
about only half the size of the rostrum, and scarcely exceeding
in size the fixed tergum. The <i>fixed scutum</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span>) is large,
larger even than the carina; it is oblong, and its shape is
more simple than in the other species; this is chiefly
owing to the rostrum articulating with the whole of that
margin (<i>b</i>) which answers to the basal margin of the moveable
valve; whereas in the other species (fig. <a href="#p21f01b">1 <i>b</i></a>) it curls
beyond this margin, and articulates with the very protuberant,
so-called, parietal portion of the valve. Three or four
rounded prominent longitudinal ribs, exactly like the homologous
ribs on the moveable scutum, run from the apex of
the fixed scutum to the basal margin, and their extremities
form the teeth by which it articulates, as just stated, with
the rostrum. Its upper articular ridge (′) is more prominent,
and placed much lower down in the suture between it
and the fixed tergum, than in the foregoing species. The
ledge (<i>o</i>) by which the orifice is kept neatly closed, is
here more distinct than in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>: this ledge is neces<a name="Page_524" id="Page_524" href="#Page_524"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 524]</span></a>sary,
as well as in the case of the fixed tergum, owing to
the altered shape of the summits of the moveable scutum
and tergum, due to their corrosion and to their coming to
project freely. But the most remarkable character of the
fixed scutum is, that on the under side there is no great
adductor plate, but a rounded hollow with its lower edge
only slightly prominent; the absence of the adductor plate,
which is present in all the other species of the genus, is
no doubt due to the under side of this valve being inclined
even outwards, and so standing in some degree opposed to the
moveable valve; thus affording on its under surface a place
for the attachment of the lower end of the adductor scutorum
muscle; whereas in the other species this muscle
could not possibly have been attached, without the aid of
an adductor plate, to the under side of the much depressed
and sloping fixed valve. The <i>fixed tergum</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">T′</span>) is a little
more simple in form than the corresponding valve in the
other species; the two arms, answering to the occludent
and carinal margins of the moveable tergum, are more nearly
equal in length: the internal transverse ledge, separating
these rims or margins from the parietal portion of the valve,
is but little developed.</p>

<p>All four valves forming the shell are remarkable from
having, when full-grown, but not whilst young, their basal
edges abruptly inflected inwards, thus forming a ledge all
round the basal membrane, as in <a href="#Chthamalus_intertextus"><i>Chthamalus intertextus</i></a> and
<a href="#Chthamalus_Hembeli"><i>Hembeli</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Moveable Scutum.</i>—This is slightly larger in proportion
to the tergum than in the foregoing species: it is chiefly
remarkable from the presence of three prominent longitudinal
ridges on the main part of the valve, like the two
articular ridges on the tergal margin; of these latter,
the lower one extends down to about the middle of the
tergal margin. The <i>moveable tergum</i> is rhomboidal, with
the whole carinal portion marked only by lines of growth:
it is only remarkable by the upper of the three articular
ridges on the scutal margin being unusually distinct from
the occludent margin.</p>

<p>With respect to the animal's body, its several peculiarities
have already been pointed out under the genus. The<a name="Page_525" id="Page_525" href="#Page_525"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 525]</span></a>
<i>labrum</i> is decidedly bullate, triangular in section, with a
row of minute bead-like teeth on the crest; the palpi are
very narrow and short, and do not nearly touch each other:
this variation in the structure of the labrum and in the size
of the palpi, is very remarkable, considering how important,
in a classificatory point of view, these parts are in all other
Cirripedes. In the <i>mandibles</i> there are either two or three
main teeth, with the whole lower part of the organ pectinated
with sharp spines. <i>Cirri</i>: the first pair is not short;
in the individual examined, the two rami had eleven and
twelve segments. In the second pair, the shorter ramus
was two thirds of the length of the longer ramus, the segments
being in number ten and fifteen; in the arrangement
of the spines this second pair resembles its homologue in
the three other species. In the third pair, the two rami are
very nearly equal in length, having sixteen and eighteen
segments; and the segments of the anterior ramus are only
a little thicker and more thickly clothed with spines than
those of the posterior ramus. The remaining cirri and the
caudal appendages are as in the other species.</p>

<p class="p2">M. Bosquet has admirably figured and described the
several separated valves belonging to this species, and I
owe to his great kindness an examination of some of them.
In Mr. J. de C. Sowerby's collection, also, there is a single
specimen, attached to a Mollusc, with the four valves of the
shell united together, but without the two moveable opercular
valves; it cannot be positively asserted that this is the
same species with that of M. Bosquet, but such probably is<a name="Page_526" id="Page_526" href="#Page_526"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 526]</span></a>
the case. This is the species to which I alluded in the
<a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a> to my 'Monograph on Fossil Lepadidæ.'
It is an interesting species, from being the only known
Secondary one, but in itself it is a very poorly characterised
form, and I can point out no important character in the
shell by which it can be recognised. The rostrum and
carina, which are of nearly equal sizes, are locked together
by the usual interfolding plates, and likewise to the fixed
scutum and tergum; but these latter plates seem to have been
less developed in M. Bosquet's specimen than in the English.
The fixed scutum has a large adductor plate, which seems
to have been chipped in M. Bosquet's specimen; this valve
and the fixed tergum in all essential respects resemble the
same valves in <a href="#Verruca_Stromia"><i>V. Strömia</i></a>. The surface of the shell is very
smooth.</p>

<p>The <i>moveable scutum</i> has its occludent margin considerably
arched: the lower articular ridge is broader than the

only have alluded to its existence, had it not been for the
genus <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, which differs in so many important characters
from the other members of the Lepadidæ, that formerly
I did not even suspect that it could belong to this
Family, and therefore deferred its examination. The genus
<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> was discovered, well described and illustrated, in
1849, by Mr. Hancock; to whose very great kindness I am
indebted for permission to dissect and examine his entire
stock of this truly remarkable Cirripede. In the classification
of the whole class I have not felt so much doubt, as
whether I ought to institute a family for the reception of
this genus. <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> differs from all other Cirripedes
(putting on one side for the instant, the males and complemental
males of Ibla and Scalpellum) in the very singular
fact of being destitute of a rectum and anus;—in
the three segments of the thorax, which usually support
the second, third, and fourth pairs of cirri, being without any
appendages;—in the fifth and sixth pairs of cirri having their
inner or posterior rami metamorphosed into very singular
roughened cushions or buttons, which apparently serve to
triturate the food;—in the caudal appendages being muscular,
and being used conjointly with the cirri;—and lastly,
in the pupa having a lesser number of segments in its abdomen
and caudal appendages than in (as far as I have seen)
any other Cirripede. It will be thought that these characters
are amply sufficient to justify the placing <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>
in a separate family, more especially when the close general
resemblance in the animal's body in most of the other members
of the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, <a href="#Family_Verrucidae">Verrucidæ</a>, and Lepadidæ, is borne in
mind. On the other hand, the males and complemental males
of Scalpellum and Ibla must indisputably be considered as
members of the Lepadidæ; yet the male of <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>
and <i>ornatum</i> has no stomach, anus, or mouth, which is a
far more abnormal structure than the absence only of the
anus in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>: the cirri, also, in these same males, differ
from the ordinary cirripedial type decidedly more than in
<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>. Again, in the male of Ibla, all the cirri, excepting
the fifth and sixth pairs, are aborted, and these two pairs
are usually only uniramous; here, then, we have a decided
resemblance to <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>. Hence, if we might assume that<a name="Page_528" id="Page_528" href="#Page_528"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 528]</span></a>
the female <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> had partially assumed characters confined
to the males of the other genera, it would assuredly
stand amongst the Lepadidæ. Independently of this comparison
with the foregoing males, the affinities of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>
are so special to several genera amongst the Lepadidæ, that
it seems unnatural to force it out of the position which it
well occupies between Ibla and Anelasma, and place it in
another family by itself: thus, in being bisexual, and in the
general character of its very curious males, <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> shows
an affinity to Ibla and Scalpellum; and to the former of
these genera it is related in several particulars, such as in
the body being lodged within the peduncle, and in the
structure of the larval antennæ, &amp;c.: to Anelasma and
Alepas it is allied in the general character, and to a certain
extent in the muscles, of the capitulum; Anelasma, also,
has all its cirri to a certain degree rudimentary, and
<i>Alepas cornuta</i> has the inner rami of the fifth and sixth pairs
of cirri,—namely, the very same rami which are so curiously
modified in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>,—small, destitute of muscles, and functionless
for their proper purpose: to Anelasma and Lithotrya
it is allied in the peculiarity of the lower end of the
peduncle becoming elongated by growth, and in being
imbedded; and to Lithotrya by its powers of excavation and
manner of attachment. Now, I believe it generally holds
good that when a form is really distinct from another group,
its affinities are general, or only in a slight degree special to
the members of that group. Nor, indeed, can it be asserted
that <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> differs much more, somewhat more it certainly
does, from the other genera, than does Anelasma, with its
more singular mouth, spineless rudimentary cirri, and fimbriated
peduncle; and I have never regretted having included
this genus amongst the Lepadidæ. Hence, after
much consideration, I have resolved to consider <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> as
one of the Lepadidæ, though so curiously modified,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[142]</span></a> and<a name="Page_529" id="Page_529" href="#Page_529"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 529]</span></a>
having characters confined to the males of the other genera.
Perhaps I have been in some degree influenced by the
difficulty of finding external characters by which to separate
<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> as a family from the other Lepadidæ.</p>

<p>I may premise that after the sketch of the leading peculiarities
of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and after the discussion on its affinities,
just given under the Family, I think it would be superfluous
to institute a full generic description, separately from the following
detailed account of this most anomalous cirripede.</p>

<p><i>General Appearance.</i>—The whole animal is from .2 to
.3 of an inch in length, of a soft texture, colourless or
yellowish, and lives concealed in a cavity of its own
formation in the shells of certain Gasteropods. This cavity
communicates with the water by a narrow fissure-like orifice
(Pl. <a href="#Page_706">22</a>, fig. <a href="#p22f04">4</a>), broadest at the posterior end, where the cirri
are exserted; narrow, closed, and generally curved at the
other (<i>a</i>) end: the two sides of the fissure (<i>b</i>) are commonly
bordered by a calcareous inorganic deposit: the walls of
the cavity are worn so thin over the peduncle, at the
narrow end of the fissure, that the orange-coloured ovaria
can generally be seen through the shell of the mollusc, and
hence there is here a distinct fan-shaped stain (fig. <a href="#p22f03">3</a>) on
the surface. The animal consists of a compressed capitulum,
without valves, and of a sort of peduncle depressed
on its rostral face, and covered with a broad, oval, thin,
horny disc. We must remember that in the Lepadidæ the
peduncle does not essentially differ from the capitulum,
being only the flexible lower or anterior end of the animal,
and is separated from the capitulum only by shape, and
generally by the direction of the lines of growth. The disc,
when most regular (fig. <a href="#p22f01">1</a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>), lies in a plane at right angles
to the sides of the capitulum, and almost in a line with the
orifice leading into the sack; but the peduncle is often very
irregular (fig. <a href="#p22f02">2</a>), and the disc comes even to occupy a position<a name="Page_531" id="Page_531" href="#Page_531"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 531]</span></a>
nearly parallel to one or the other side of the capitulum.
On the carinal side, the capitulum is generally separated
from the peduncle by a rather deep fold (<i>f</i>, in the section
fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>), but this depends in some degree upon the state of
distension of the mass of ovarian cæca. I have given a
drawing, fig. <a href="#p22f01">1</a> (partly taken from Mr. Hancock), of a very
regular individual, and of an extremely distorted specimen
(fig. <a href="#p22f02">2</a>). The distortion, I believe, is generally caused by
the animal, during its excavation, breaking into some old
cavity.</p>

<p><i>External Structure.</i>—The orifice leading into the sack is
about one third of the total length of the animal: its edges
or lips are thickened, horny, and brownish: at the lower end,
exactly where the orifice ends, the lips are formed, from
being deeply notched, into two sharp projections (<i>a</i>, figs.
<a href="#p22f01">1</a>, <a href="#p22f05">5</a>, <a href="#p22f06">6</a>), unlike anything occurring in any other Cirripede.
The external membrane (<i>c</i>, fig. <a href="#p22f06">6</a>) of the lip supports an
irregular but nearly straight band of sharp, thick spines of
chitine, about 1/1000th of an inch in length, together with a
few hairs: at the carinal or upper end of the orifice the
spines are largest and most numerous; at the other and
lower end, they decrease in size; and on the two projections
(<i>a</i>, fig. <a href="#p22f06">6</a>), and on the adjoining parts of the external
membrane, they graduate into the small dentated points
which cover the whole surface of the animal. The inner
tunic of the sack (<i>b</i>), on each side along the upper half of
the orifice, is remarkable from having a moderately broad,
curved band of short, sharp spines, not quite so thick as
those on the external surface, closely adpressed together
and pointing upwards, like the javelins of an ancient phalanx,
thus probably preventing the ingress of any intruding animal.
This band of spines curves at the upper end, conformably
with the shape of the orifice. The inner tunic of the sack
in this upper part is yellowish, and, what is very unusual, is
thicker than the external membrane. A little way down,
within the orifice, and more especially in front of an elegant
row of hairs on the two sides of the great labrum, there is
a band of very fine but stiff hairs (5/1000ths of an inch in
length), pointing upwards, and making together with those
on the labrum a hedge, barring ingress into the sack.</p>

<p><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532" href="#Page_532"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 532]</span></a></p>

<p>The external membrane over the whole animal, excepting
the horny disc which covers the rostral face of the peduncle,
is very thin and transparent; it is periodically and often
moulted, as may be inferred from the many old lines of
junction round the edges of the horny disc: it is irregularly
and pretty thickly (but not so thickly as in fig. <a href="#p22f07">7</a>) studded
with star-headed, minute points, from 2 to 5/10,000ths of an inch in
diameter, composed of hard chitine, seated on a short footstall,
and this on a circular, yellowish, slightly thickened
disc of the general investing membrane, appearing like a
halo surrounding each little point. These points are directed
obliquely upwards. There are none on the horny disc,
though particularly numerous close to its margin. Their
state varies much: just after a moult, when newly formed,
the spines are regularly star-headed, with quite sharp rays,
from two to six in number, with some of them occasionally
bifid; but these points or rays soon become blunted,
and ultimately half the star is worn away, so that the
appearance then presented is that of a crescent with a
few blunt points on its convex side. At each exuviation,
the thickened membrane of the orifice with its strong external
spines (the condition of which also varies according
to the period elapsed since the last moult), and of course
the whole internal tunic of the sack, with its spines and hairs,
are all moulted, together with the external membrane and
the little star-shaped points. In most specimens a barely
distinguishable band or bar of yellowish, slightly thickened
membrane, runs from the points (<i>a</i>), at the lower end of
the orifice, for some way obliquely downwards; and at the
lower end of this bar the weak adductor scutorum muscle
(having transverse striæ) is attached. This bar is often
strengthened by a prominent external fold of membrane,
but yet it is so flexible, and as it is united only to the
lower end of the orifice, I can hardly believe that it can,
by means of the adductor muscle attached to its opposite
extremity, have much power in closing the orifice. I
believe that this muscle acts simply in narrowing the
whole animal, so as to favour its movement within the
cavity in which it is imbedded. Owing to this position of
the adductor muscle, and its consequent little power in<a name="Page_533" id="Page_533" href="#Page_533"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 533]</span></a>
closing the orifice, we can understand the necessity for the
defence afforded by the bands of spines and hairs on the
inner tunic of the sack and on the labrum, which do not
occur in other Cirripedes.</p>

<p><i>Horny disc.</i>—The general shape of the disc, its irregularity
and position, have been already described. It never
extends, as remarked by Mr. Hancock, to the extreme lower
point of the peduncle; upwards it reaches to a little below
the lower end of the orifice. It consists of successive layers
of membrane, either moderately thick and opaque, or only a
little thicker than the general membrane of the body, but
never furnished with the little sharp points; it increases in
size, in like manner as the calcareous valves of other Cirripedes,
the undermost and last formed layer extending beyond
the others, with its edge united, till the next exuviation, to
the general membrane of the body. The disc is attached,
at its upper end, apparently in the usual way, by cement,
to the roof of the cavity of the shell in which it is imbedded;
but the lower parts of the disc are also slightly and partially
attached, chiefly along the lines of growth or exuviation;
and this, I suspect, is effected by an inorganic calcareous
deposit; anyhow I could not perceive here any cement or
cement-ducts. Beyond the circumference of the disc the
whole animal lies free in its cavity. The lines of growth in
the middle part of the disc are generally obliterated by the
decay of the older and outer layers. These lines, though of
course ordinarily conformable with the general outline of
the disc, are not always so, for the disc sometimes becomes
during growth slightly changed in form, and the animal,
consequently, slightly changed in position; sometimes
either one or the other side or the upper end of the disc
is left deserted by the new layers of the growing disc;
these being formed on the deserted side of less size or extension,
instead of larger size, as they normally should be
all round the disc.</p>

<p>The upper end of the disc is always produced into a
projection of not regular shape, but generally hollowed out
or embayed in front (fig. <a href="#p22f01">1</a>), and almost always hollowed
out on the two sides. This projection stands directly over
the adductor muscle (<i>b</i> in fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>), and on the exterior surface<a name="Page_534" id="Page_534" href="#Page_534"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 534]</span></a>
is generally convex, being concave on the under side for the
attachment of several muscles presently to be described. The
horny layers are in this part usually thicker than elsewhere.
The disc is thus upwardly produced, owing apparently to
the fissure which leads into the cavity of the shell of the
mollusc becoming, during the process of excavation, considerably
longer than is necessary,—that is longer than the
orifice leading into the sack; and consequently, for the protection
of the imbedded animal, the lower and narrow end
of the fissure is closed on its under side by this upward
production of the horny disc, formed of layers of membrane
of unusual thickness. A deposition, also, of lime, hereafter
to be mentioned, gives further protection.</p>

<p>In the bays on each side of the upward production of
the horny disc, and likewise a little lower down on its edges,
and therefore somewhat protected by lying within the narrow,
pointed, lower end of the fissure in the shell of the mollusc,
the short-lived Males (Pl. <a href="#Page_706">22</a>, fig. <a href="#p22f01">1</a>, <i>m</i>) are attached often
in groups of two, three, or more together.</p>

<p>It may be asked to what part, in other Cirripedes, does
the horny disc answer? Not considering the upward prolongation,
which has been developed for a special purpose,
the disc is irregularly circular,—is added to all round,—serves
for the attachment of the whole animal to the supporting
surface,—is covered on the under surface by a
conformable and parallel mass of ovarian cæca, and the latter
by the inner tunic of the sack; therefore in every character,
and in its relation to the other parts of the animal, the
disc answers to the end of the peduncle, or to the basal cup
in Lithotrya, or still more closely to the basis in sessile
cirripedes, with the important exception that it lies in a
line with the longitudinal axis of the whole animal instead
of at right angles to this axis. We know that all ordinary
cirripedes become first permanently attached in their pupal
state by their antennæ, which are seated on the ventral or
rostral surface, near to the anterior end of the body; and
that from the young cirripede, after the act of metamorphosis,
being turned vertically upwards, and from the extreme
anterior, now lower, end of the body not being
rapidly developed, the surface cemented down, or the basis,<a name="Page_535" id="Page_535" href="#Page_535"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 535]</span></a>
encroaches almost equally on the dorsal, lateral, and ventral
surfaces. But if we were to suppose the extreme anterior
point of the body to be rapidly developed, the surface of
attachment or basis, without it grew still more rapidly,
could not possibly reach the dorsal surface, and would,
consequently, be confined to the ventral or rostral surface.
I have not seen the young of the ordinary or female <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>
soon after its metamorphosis, but in the male the development
of the extreme anterior end of the body is extraordinarily
rapid, and from analogy we may fairly conclude that
this is likewise the case with the female. Hence I believe
that the horny disc answers to the cemented down, lower end
of the peduncle, in other members of the Lepadidæ, and to
the basis in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, and that it is confined to the ventral
or rostral surface, owing to the anterior or lower end of
the body having been rapidly developed. To make all the
parts, internal and external, of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, correspond with
those of other cirripedes, the main circular part of the horny
disc must be turned up at nearly right angles to its present
position (the dorsal or carinal integuments, to the right-hand
in fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>, being shortened), and then we should have
a peduncle, certainly very short and broad, but holding its
proper relative position.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[143]</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_143_143" id="Footnote_143_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_143_143"><span class="label">[143]</span></a> In the genus Lithotrya,
as long as the animal continues to bore into the
rock, the calcareous discs by which it is attached in its cavity, stand, as in
<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> (Pl. 8, fig. 2, 2 <i>a′</i>, Darwin's 'Monograph on the Lepadidæ'), parallel to
the longitudinal axis, but as soon as the animal ceases to bore, and the discs
become converted into a cup, they occupy a normal position at right angles to
the peduncle. According to Reinhardt, these discs, in Lithotrya, are situated
on the carinal or dorsal surface of the peduncle, at which statement I now feel
considerable surprise, as undoubtedly the pupa must first permanently attach
itself by its prehensile antennæ on its ventral or rostral surface. In Anelasma
I failed to discover any cement or cement-ducts; but I am now strongly
inclined to believe, considering that the extreme lower or anterior end goes on
growing, that the surface of attachment will be found to occur, as in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>,
on the rostral surface, a little way below the orifice.</p></div>

<p><i>Sack and its Muscles.</i>—I have already described the
curious phalanx of spines, the long fine hairs, and thickened
condition of the inner tunic of the sack along the sides of
the orifice. This inner tunic is a reflexion from that enveloping
the body of the animal, in the usual manner, as
may be seen in the section (Pl. <a href="#Page_706">22</a>, fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>). Between the external
membrane and the inner tunic of the sack (<i>e</i>), there<a name="Page_536" id="Page_536" href="#Page_536"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 536]</span></a>
is of course the usual double fold of corium, these two
folds being united by minute, transverse, ligamentous
fibres, branched at the two ends, as in other Lepadidæ.
Imbedded in the corium there are numerous, longitudinal,
striæ-less muscles, which do not run quite up to the orifice,
but to an oblique line beneath it. Externally to these
muscles there are, as in the other Lepadidæ, fine transverse
muscles, confined to the middle part of the animal, and
running from the carinal margin more than half way round
both sides. Attached to the upper notched or folded end of
the orifice (<i>g</i>, fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>, above the upper ends of the longitudinal
muscles), there is a fan of rather strong, striæ-less muscles,
expanding downwards, with their lower extremities attached
to the outer membrane of the capitulum; these muscles
apparently serve to open the orifice: there is a somewhat
analogous muscle in Lithotrya, but in no other member of
the Family: in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, however, there is a closely
similar muscle. Owing to the action of these several
muscles, the tissues forming the capitulum and peduncle
are, according to Mr. Hancock, highly contractile.</p>

<p>I have stated that the under surface of the upper produced
end of the horny disc is concave, and serves for the
attachment of several muscles. Of these some run to the
basal margin of the great labrum, and no doubt, as usual,
move the whole mouth; others, as usual, run to the skin
between the labrum and the lower end of the orifice,—<i>i. e.</i>
in fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>, between the lower end of the row of fine
hairs (see fig. <a href="#p22f11">11</a>), which shows where the basal margin
of the labrum is situated, and the lower side of the point
(<i>a</i>), where the orifice terminates: others run obliquely
on both sides towards the point of attachment of the small
adductor scutorum muscle (<i>b</i>, fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>): others, of considerable
strength, and these are more peculiar, run and are attached
to the lower end of the orifice (<i>a</i>), and serve apparently
to draw up the orifice from within the fissure-like cavity,
in which it lies lodged: others, again, extend transversely
on both sides, close beneath the inner tunic of the sack,
a little beyond the line whence the ovigerous fræna or
branchiæ arise. These transverse muscles lie within the
longitudinal muscles, and therefore are quite different from<a name="Page_537" id="Page_537" href="#Page_537"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 537]</span></a>
the exterior transverse muscles, which are situated more
towards the carinal portion of the peduncle and capitulum,
and which are common to most Lepadidæ. The internal
transverse muscles, and those running to the lower end of
the orifice, are peculiar, but we shall hereafter meet with
them even more developed in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>.</p>

<p>Along the medial carinal line there is, between the two
layers of corium, the usual circulatory channel. On each
side of this line, on the inside of the sack, there are generally
some slight irregular swellings, and sometimes a large
extent of the inner surface is irregularly carunculated with
little knobs. The sack (<i>e</i> in fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>) extends down almost to
the basal point of the peduncle (<i>d</i>), more especially when
the ovarian cæca are not gorged with ova.</p>

<p><i>Branchiæ, or ovigerous Fræna.</i>—Within the sack, on
each side of the body, rising not far from the ends of the
adductor muscle (<i>b</i>), there is a large fillet or fold; the two
occupy so exactly the position of the ovigerous fræna that
I cannot doubt such is their nature, though, as happens in
the case of some species of Pollicipes, they are destitute of
their proper glands, and so do not serve for the attachment
of the ovigerous lamellæ; this attachment probably is not
required, owing to the protected situation which the lamellæ
hold in the sack, under the animal's body, and over the
ovarian cæca. From the unusually large size of these so-called
fræna, I cannot doubt that they serve as branchiæ,
equally well with the plicated folds of membrane, believed
to be homologous with the fræna, in the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>, which
have by every one been considered as branchiæ. The fræna
are broad and truncated at their upper ends; their margins
are sinuous, and their outer surfaces papillose; they run
longitudinally down the sack, narrowing as they extend,
almost to the basal point of the peduncle, and hence are of
considerable length; they are hidden in the section (fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>)
by the medial, somewhat protuberant mass (<i>c</i>) of ovarian
cæca, and partly by the (<i>i</i>) prosoma.</p>

<p><i>Body.</i>—The body is constructed on the usual type, and
indeed does not differ greatly from that of Ibla. The
labrum is very large, its lower or basal margin is separated
by an unusual space (capable of being contracted or folded)<a name="Page_538" id="Page_538" href="#Page_538"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 538]</span></a>
from the lower end of the orifice of the sack; hence the
labrum and whole mouth is placed quite remarkably near
the upper (or carinal) end of the orifice. This upper end of
the orifice, I may remind the reader, is homologically the
posterior end of the general covering or carapace, and all that
portion of the whole animal (as the sectional figure, <a href="#p22f05">5</a>, stands)
below the lower margin of the labrum, on the rostral or
ventral surface, is formed by the three anterior segments of
the head. The main part of the body, carrying the mouth,
is formed by the great development of that segment of the
thorax which bears the first pair of cirri (<i>h</i>), here closely adpressed,
as usual, to the sides of the mouth. The lower
portion of this segment forms the prosoma (<i>i</i>), and has the
characteristic outline, but is not much developed. On each
side of the prosoma an oval space of membrane is yellowish
and is thickened, and so gives support to this part of the
body. The five succeeding thoracic segments, which ought to
carry the five succeeding and posterior pairs of cirri, are
together of very small size (as in Ibla), in comparison with
either the prosoma, or the whole anterior part of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: theanimal">the animal</span>.
The segment (<i>k</i>) which should have borne the second pair of
cirri, is considerably longer than the following segments, and
is at the same time less distinct, owing to an oval convex shield
of thickened membrane on the sides, not extending the whole
length of the segment, thus causing two transverse creases,
which, when the thorax is contracted, appear like two additional
segments. Had this segment borne cirri, they
would have stood, as in Ibla, at a considerable distance
from the first pair. The segments (<i>l</i>, <i>m</i>) which should have
borne the third and fourth pairs of cirri are like each other,
except that the former is rather the longest. The membrane
covering all the thorax is surprisingly thin; and at
the articulations, which are straight and transverse, is
deeply folded, so that the thorax must be highly extensible,
to a degree which I have not seen equalled in any Cirripede
except in the males of <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i> and <i>ornatum</i>.
The thorax is represented as somewhat extended in fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>.
This part of the thorax is amply furnished with striated
and striæ-less muscles for its retraction and protrusion, and
for lateral movements. The segment (<i>m</i>) which should<a name="Page_539" id="Page_539" href="#Page_539"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 539]</span></a>
have borne the fourth pair of cirri, at first sight falsely
appears like the terminal segment of the thorax: in one
monstrous specimen it bore a single cirrus, showing (if
there had been any doubt) that it was a true segment.
The three terminal pairs of articulated appendages, form
together a brush; they consist of the fifth and sixth pairs
of cirri and of the caudal appendages: my reasons for
considering the last-named organs as of caudal origin will
be given hereafter. A moderately careful inspection, especially
of the ventral surface, will show that the fifth pair of
cirri are borne on a small segment (<i>n</i>, fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>, but plainer
in fig. <a href="#p22f13">13</a>), which is quite distinct from, but partially concealed
by, that which ought to bear (and did bear in
the monstrous case) the fourth pair of cirri: this segment
is oblique, and cannot be traced distinctly all round
the dorsal surface. The segment (<i>o</i>, fig. <a href="#p22f13">13</a>) bearing the
sixth pair is much less distinct, and can only be seen
by a longitudinal section, or when the cirri are a little
separated, but it certainly exists,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[144]</span></a> as is likewise shown by
the presence of small apodemes dipping in amongst the
muscles, between this and the last segment. The posterior
or caudal appendages are closely approximated; they are
not separated by any fold from the sixth thoracic segment;
but <i>appear</i> as if they were articulated on the dorsal surface
of the sixth pair of cirri, in exactly the manner usual in
the other Lepadidæ. The segments bearing the fifth and
sixth pairs of cirri are highly oblique to the preceding
segments, and consequently the cirri, which they support,
instead of projecting inwards, lie like a brush in a line
with the longitudinal axis of the main part of the thorax.
The membrane forming the two small oblique terminal segments
of the thorax is strengthened by irregularly shaped
plates of thicker and yellowish membrane.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_144_144" id="Footnote_144_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> In the middle, the fold is slightly prominent and pointed, and being most
finely villose, I for some time looked at this projection as a rudiment of the
probosciformed penis.</p></div>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The mouth is constructed on the strictly normal
type of the Family, but is peculiar in every part; it is
remarkable from being situated so near the upper (or posterior)
end of the capitulum, this being caused by the great<a name="Page_540" id="Page_540" href="#Page_540"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 540]</span></a>
length of the labrum, and of the space of body between the
latter and the lower end of the orifice. The <i>labrum</i> is a
very singular part of the mouth from its vast size and outline:
in fig. <a href="#p22f08">8</a>, we have a front view of the mouth, of which
the whole upper pointed part consists of the labrum, and
<i>h h</i> is the first pair of cirri; in fig. <a href="#p22f11">11</a>, we have a lateral
view of the labrum, with the surrounding thin membrane
of the body, <i>a</i>—<i>a</i>, still adhering to its edges; <i>h</i> is the first
cirrus on the near side; <i>m</i> the mandible, a little distorted
in order to show its tooth, marking the position of the
transverse crest of the labrum and of the orifice of the œsophagus;
<i>b b</i> is the medial longitudinal ridge of the labrum.
In the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a> the labrum forms a mere rim to the back
of the mouth, consisting of an inner fold running down
the œsophagus, and of an outer fold, both close together:
in the Lepadidæ the folds are separated, the outer one being
swollen or bullate; and here this structure is carried to even
a greater extreme than in Ibla and its allies. The distance
between the transverse crest over the œsophagus and the
blunt projecting point on the summit of the medial ridge, <i>b b</i>,
equals twice the longitudinal diameter of the rest of the mouth.
The lower margin on each side of the labrum is produced
into two projections (fig. <a href="#p22f11">11</a>), the longer one curling round
to a point beneath the jaws, with its extremity imbedded as
an apodeme. Another very peculiar character in the
labrum, prominently noticed by Mr. Hancock, is caused by
a longitudinal row, on each side, of closely approximate, long,
very finely pointed hairs, which, as already stated, are fronted
on the opposed internal surface of the sack by an irregular
band of still finer hairs. The surface of the labrum is partially
covered by minute toothed scales, and these, seen on
the longitudinal medial ridge, <i>b b</i>, give it a finely denticulated
structure. At each end of the transverse crest which overhangs
the œsophagus, there is a knob, such as occurs on
the labrum of every Cirripede. United to these two knobs,
which are formed of thick and yellowish membrane, and
springing from the adjoining sides of the mandibles, there
are two swellings formed of thin membrane (fig. <a href="#p22f08">8</a>), which
occupy the exact position of the palpi, and may be considered
as these organs in a rudimentary condition and
destitute of bristles.</p>

<p><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541" href="#Page_541"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 541]</span></a></p>

<p>The <i>mandibles</i> are simpler than in any other Cirripede;
they are minute; they consist of an oblong plate, with only
one very strong tooth at the upper end: the face towards
the labrum is swollen: beneath the upper free part there
is a small, sub-triangular piece of thickened membrane, let
in and forming part of the general outer surface of the
mouth, and representing the large square plate found in
other Cirripedes. The <i>maxillæ</i> (fig. <a href="#p22f15">15</a>) are smaller but
broader than the mandibles; they have an upper tooth
and a smaller lower one, lying not quite in the same plane
with the upper one, but nearer the mandibles. The
apodeme (fig. <a href="#p22f08">8</a>, <a href="#p22f15">15</a>) is of remarkable length, extending
beneath the basal fold of the mouth: it does not arise
from the ridge or outer edge of the maxilla, but a little
on one side, from the face directed towards the mandible.
Between maxillæ and mandibles there is a very singular
prominent fold of membrane (fig. <a href="#p22f08">8</a>, <a href="#p22f15">15</a>), which resembles,
but probably falsely, the supposed rudimentary palpus
attached to the mandible. Altogether the maxillæ differ
considerably from the same part in other Cirripedes. In
structure they seem adapted to assume the function of mandibles;
but they do not stand directly over the œsophagus.
The <i>outer maxillæ</i> (fig. <a href="#p22f08">8</a>) appear like a minute, deeply
notched lower lip: each consists of a simple, oblong,
rounded plate, with a few small bristles at its upper end.
The basal fold of the mouth in front, beneath the outer
maxillæ is distinct, and runs in a line with the basal articulation
of the first pair of cirri. In the rudimentary palpi,
minute and little developed outer maxillæ; and in the inner
maxillæ, taking the function of the mandibles, the mouth
of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> presents some resemblance with that of Anelasma.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—These consist of the first, fifth, and sixth pairs:
the other pairs are absent, except in one monstrous specimen,
in which there was a fourth cirrus quite like the
fifth. <i>First pair</i>, fig. <a href="#p22f14">14</a>, these are seated on each side of the
mouth in the usual position. They are formed of very thin
and flexible membrane. The pedicel, as usual, consists of
two segments, the upper one is short and not very distinct;
but when viewed on the inner side can be seen to have<a name="Page_542" id="Page_542" href="#Page_542"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 542]</span></a>
the ordinary structure: both segments are destitute of
bristles. There are two short rami, being about one
third of the length of the pedicel: they are directed either
in the line of the pedicel, or more commonly posteriorly,
that is towards the other cirri, and therefore in an unusual
direction. The anterior ramus is generally rather longer
and thinner (as is commonly the case with other Cirripedes)
than the posterior ramus; but there is some variation in
this respect. On neither ramus is there any trace of the
ordinary articulations: both are thickly clothed with fine
bristles, which are singular from being thickened in their
lower parts, and plumose, like a feather. These cirri have
some resemblance, as remarked by Mr. Hancock, to a pair
of pincers; but they cannot act as such; they serve, I
believe, as brushes. Delicate muscles, transversely striated,
enter and are attached within both rami and within both
segments of the pedicel, on the usual type, showing that
these organs (if there had been any doubt) are truly cirri.</p>

<p>The <i>fifth</i> and <i>sixth pairs</i> of cirri (fig. <a href="#p22f13">13</a>, <i>n′</i>, <i>o′</i>) are almost
exactly alike: they are of very small size: each cirrus consists
of four segments: the lower or basal segment is broad,
with a few minute bristles scattered on its inner surface:
the second segment is also broad, but shorter, with a few,
generally hooked bristles, in two short irregular rows, in
the upper part: these two segments answer to the two
segments of the pedicel of ordinary cirri. The third segment
is thinner and longer than the second; it bears two
or three longitudinal rows of bristles, most of which are
neatly hooked at the point; its upper end is surrounded
with a circle of bristles. The fourth and terminal segment
is short, thin, and simple, with only a few bristles at
the apex. These two upper segments are bent a little inwards;
they answer to one of the two normal rami of
ordinary cirri. The third segment does not stand exactly
on the middle of the summit of the second segment,—the
posterior corner of the latter being occupied by a very
curious, convex, oblong, rather hard (especially in the lower
part), protuberant cushion (as called by Mr. Hancock) or
button (fig. <a href="#p22f09">9</a>, <i>c′</i>), transversely wrinkled by fine, distinctly
crenated ridges. This button presents a considerably dif<a name="Page_543" id="Page_543" href="#Page_543"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 543]</span></a>ferent
appearance according to the point of view, fig. <a href="#p22f09">9</a>, <a href="#p22f10">10</a>:
on one of its sides it projects beyond the outline of the
second segment, whence it arises; on the other side it is
prolonged, as a smooth ridge, on the top of the second
segment, embracing to a certain extent the base of the
third segment. On the face opposite to that which has
been drawn (fig. <a href="#p22f09">9</a>) as most characteristic, it is seen to be
somewhat constricted round its base; this constriction, representing,
I believe, an articulation. When viewed directly
in front (fig. <a href="#p22f10">10</a>) its outline is oval, passing into shield-shaped.
Its longitudinal axis is 3/1000ths of an inch in length;
but it varies a little in shape and size. I shall presently
assign my reasons for believing that these buttons are the
posterior or inner rami of the fifth and sixth pairs of cirri
in a rudimentary and much modified condition.</p>

<p><i>Caudal Appendages.</i>—These (fig. <a href="#p22f13">13</a>, <i>p</i>) are placed close together,
being articulated between the bases of the sixth pair
of cirri, the lines of junction being internally marked by
minute apodemes. They consist of four segments, resembling
in every respect those forming the cirri, with the
important exception that there is not a vestige of the
button on the summit of the second segment; the segments
are not so thick as those of the cirri, and the terminal segment
is smaller.</p>

<p><i>Muscles and Functions of the Cirri.</i>—For their size, the
cirri and caudal appendages have voluntary muscles of
remarkable strength, attached within their basal segments,
and springing from the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the
so-called third and fourth (<i>l</i>, <i>m</i>) thoracic segments. Other
muscles, rising from within the basal segment of each limb,
run to the second segment, and from that to the third segment.
I could not distinctly make out whether any entered
the terminal segment. I have seen no other instance of
muscles entering the caudal appendages, but as in the pupa
they are so furnished, we here have only an embryonic character
preserved. I may remark that the fifth and sixth
cirri, consisting of two large basal and two thinner terminal
segments, is likewise an embryonic character. From the
position of the cirri, the four hard protuberant buttons or
cushions, tend to oppose each other at a common point;<a name="Page_544" id="Page_544" href="#Page_544"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 544]</span></a>
and the caudal appendages fill up a gap behind, between
the cirri of the sixth pair. I at first thought, with Mr.
Hancock, that these buttons served to catch the prey; but,
reflecting on their convexity and hardness, they appear very
badly adapted for this purpose; it would, in fact, be a marvellous
feat to secure, in the dark, any moving object between
four balls. On the other hand, this very convexity, the
hardness, and especially the crenated ridges, and the powerful
muscles (which from the first surprised me), are all well
explained, if we suppose the prey, being secured by the
terminal segments, to be triturated between these four balls:
any part which escaped upwards would, moreover, be retained
in a sort of cage, formed by the inwardly inflected
terminal segments with their hooked spines. This view
of the very curious and unparalleled use made of a modified
portion, not of the haunch, but of an upper part of the two
posterior pairs of thoracic limbs, is in some degree confirmed
by finding that <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, which has apparently
analogous habits, requires its food to be triturated, though
in this case it is effected by very different means, namely,
by four beautifully toothed discs, with brushes of hairs,
developed within the lower end of the œsophagus.</p>

<p>The prey, when caught, would probably at once be carried
by the movement of the articulated thorax to the mouth
(itself moveable), and being there secured by the mouth in
front, the caudal appendages behind, the tips of the cirri
above, and the broad pedicels of the first pair on the two
sides, it would be triturated by the four crenated buttons,
and would then be forced down the œsophagus by the
action of the simple jaws. I looked in vain in several
specimens for any object within the stomach. I believe,
that when the specimens are first taken, all half digested
food is ejected by the mouth. Whether we may thus
account for the extremely foul condition of the rami of
the first cirri in all the many specimens examined by me,
I know not; but that these rami, which are thickly clothed
with fine plumose hairs, and are furnished with delicate
muscles, act as brushes, so as to clean the orifice of the
sack, I can hardly doubt.</p>

<p><i>Homologies.</i>—I have as yet, to a certain extent, assumed<a name="Page_545" id="Page_545" href="#Page_545"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 545]</span></a>
that I have correctly named the different parts; and a few
remarks on this head may be desirable, considering the
absence of certain cirri, the singular condition of the others,
the close general resemblance of the cirri and caudal appendages,
and the fact of the latter being furnished with
muscles. The only cause for any doubt regarding the thoracic
segments is the shield of thick membrane on that segment
(<i>k</i>, fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>), which ought to have borne the second pair of
cirri, causing two transverse wrinkles (not distinguishable,
however, on the ventral surface), and sometimes making
the segment appear as if it consisted of three segments:
if it did consist of three, as there can be no doubt about
the nature of the first pair of cirri, (not in a more rudimentary
condition than in Anelasma) or about the segment
whence this first pair arises, the two terminal oblique
segments, with their appendages, would be abdominal instead
of thoracic: but this is improbable, inasmuch as the
abdomen is unusually little developed in the pupa (as
presently to be shown), and more especially from the circumstance
of a monstrous cirrus, identical in structure with
the two succeeding pairs, having been borne on a segment
(<i>m</i>), which, in any case must be considered as thoracic, for
it is well known how very rarely thoracic and abdominal
limbs resemble each other. I cannot myself feel hardly any
doubt on the nature of these three pairs of appendages;
for, in the first place, the posterior appendages are articulated
on and between the bases of the adjoining pair, <em>exactly</em>
as the undoubted caudal appendages are articulated
in all other members of the family on the sixth pair of cirri
or terminal thoracic appendages. Secondly, we see in the
male of the allied genus Ibla, the very same appendages
preserved as in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, namely, the caudal, and the fifth
and sixth pairs of cirri, which latter, moreover, are generally
uniramous. Thirdly and lastly, in the likewise allied <i>Alepas
cornuta</i>, we have the posterior rami of these same fifth and
sixth pairs of cirri in a rudimentary condition, and resembling
in every respect the caudal appendages. Assuming,
then, that the several appendages in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> have been
rightly denominated, we have to consider the nature of
their segments: in all cirripedes, the pedicels of the cirri<a name="Page_546" id="Page_546" href="#Page_546"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 546]</span></a>
consist of two segments, of which the lower one (as here)
is longer than the upper one, and both (as here) considerably
thicker than the segments of the rami: in all
cirripedial pupæ, likewise, the thick pedicels of the limbs
consist of two segments, and each ramus, also (as here), of
two segments: now, with these coincidences, and bearing
in mind that in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> the two upper segments do not
arise from the exact middle of the summit of the second
segment, but from rather its anterior side,—bearing, also,
in mind the case just cited of <i>Alepas cornuta</i> with the posterior
rami of these very same cirri rudimentary,—we may,
I think, safely conclude that here in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> the two lower
segments form the pedicel; the two upper segments, the
anterior ramus; and that the button-like protuberance is
the posterior ramus in a modified condition. As the caudal
appendages in none of the Lepadidæ, either in the mature
state or in the pupa, have two rami, we can satisfactorily
understand the absence of any trace of the button-like protuberance
on the top of the second segment.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[145]</span></a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_145_145" id="Footnote_145_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_145_145"><span class="label">[145]</span></a> I almost wish I could persuade myself that I had taken an erroneous view
of the thoracic segments, and therefore that the three pairs of terminal appendages
were all abdominal, for then <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> would come into much closer
relationship with <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>; though even in that case it would form a
distinct family from it: but I cannot alter my opinion.</p></div>

<p><i>Alimentary Canal.</i>—The œsophagus runs down from the
mouth, beneath and nearly parallel to the straight row of
hairs on the two sides of the labrum: it is surrounded by
the usual muscles: at the lower end it bends down, and
expanding a little, like a bell, enters the stomach. The
stomach is of considerable size and fills the main part of the
body, bulging out under the mouth, and prolonged as far as
about the middle of that segment (<i>l</i>), which ought to have
borne the third pair of cirri; here the stomach terminates
in a blunt rounded point. The tissue surrounding the
stomach, and keeping it in its proper place, can be traced
to the posterior end of the thorax, but there is no rectum or
anus. I am prepared to assert positively that this is the
case,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[146]</span></a> for I made repeated longitudinal sections of the whole<a name="Page_547" id="Page_547" href="#Page_547"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 547]</span></a>
thorax in two planes, and I subsequently cleaned the outer
tissues with boiling potash, and then, when as transparent
as a sheet of glass, I examined every part, and certainly
there is no rectum (which in every case is formed of chitine,
and so is not acted on by potash) nor an anal orifice. Singular
as this fact is, it is not so improbable as it at first appears;
inasmuch as I have shown, in my former volume, that the
Lepadidæ can reject half digested food by their mouth, and
secondly, that the final stage of digestion appears to take
place in the upper part of the stomach. In the male of this
very species, as we shall immediately see, there certainly
is no mouth or stomach, and apparently no rectum or anus;
so is it likewise with the males of <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i> and
<i>ornatum</i>: in <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, there is a mouth and an œsophagus,
but no stomach, rectum, or anus. There are, I believe,
no other known instances, in the whole great class of Crustacea,
of the absence of an anus.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_146_146" id="Footnote_146_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146_146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> I may venture to remark that I succeeded in every attempt, which I made,
in seeing plainly the œsophagus, and the acoustic and olfactory orifices and sacks,
which, according to all analogy, would be of much smaller size, and far more
difficult to discover, than the rectum and anus. I may mention that, according
to Mr. Newport ('Annals of Nat. Hist.,' 1849, p. 277), the larvæ of certain
parasitic Hymenoptera have a stomach without any anus. No crustacean,
according to Milne Edwards, is destitute of this orifice.</p></div>

<p>The stomach, in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, is much corrugated, so as to
be deeply pitted; but there are no regular cæca. The
enveloping hepatic layer is thick, brownish, pulpy, and
formed of pellets of cellular matter, not distinctly arranged
in lines as is general; there is the usual delicate muscular
layer. The stomach was in every case empty, and I did
not notice the separated epithelial coat, so generally found
in other cirripedes.</p>

<p><i>Organs of Sense.</i>—I failed in discovering the eye, which
I have no doubt exits, as it is conspicuous in the pupa and
in the male. The olfactory pouches are seated rather laterally
under the maxillæ, as in Ibla. As in this same genus, the
acoustic sack is seated remarkably low down (fig. <a href="#p22f05">5</a>), at
a very considerable distance beneath the basal articulation
of the first cirrus: the orifice is seated on a slight
prominence: the acoustic vesicle, I believe, is sub-cylindrical,
with irregular projections. I did not make out anything
distinctly on the nervous system.</p>

<p><i>Female Generative System.</i>—The animal we have thus
far described is exclusively female: when a longitudinal<a name="Page_548" id="Page_548" href="#Page_548"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 548]</span></a>
section of the thorax is made, and the stomach removed, it
can be most plainly seen that there are no vesiculæ seminales
or testes. Mr. Hancock has remarked on the
absence of the usual probosciformed penis. The male of
<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> will be subsequently described in detail. The
female organs differ in no respect from those of other members
of the family, excepting in so far that the layer or
mass formed by the ovarian cæca (<i>c</i>) does not lie transversely
to the longitudinal axis of the whole animal, but longitudinally
under the horny disc. The ovigerous fræna are
largely developed, but serve, as previously stated, as branchiæ,
and not for their proper function of giving attachment to
the ovigerous lamellæ. The ovigerous lamella is single,
and nearly corresponds, in size and shape (as would ensue
from the manner of its formation) to the under side of the
horny disc. The ova are broadly oval, and rather above
1/100th of an inch in length.</p>

<p><i>Metamorphoses.</i>—The larva in the first stage has been
fully described and figured by Mr. Hancock: it differs in
no essential respect from other larvæ of the family. Mr.
Hancock overlooked the inferior minute antennæ. With
respect to the larvæ in the last stage, or pupa, I obtained
several specimens attached to the disc of the female, and
which were on the point of being developed into males;
and another specimen identical in all respects, but attached
independently to the shell of the mollusc, and which, therefore,
I have every reason to suppose, would have been
developed into a female. In any case these pupæ may
be conveniently here described (Pl. <a href="#Page_707">23</a>, fig. <a href="#p23f16">16</a>.) They
are .025 of an inch in length; they are of the usual shape,
with the anterior end not very blunt and the postero-ventral
surface somewhat produced. The whole carapace
or shell is very thin and smooth. There are six pairs of
thoracic natatory legs, situated far back towards the posterior
end of the body; each leg has the usual articulations,
and the two rami their usual long but not plumose spines;
the presence of the legs deserves notice, considering the
rudimentary and modified state of their homologues in the
mature animal. The abdomen differs considerably from
the same part, as far as I have seen, in other pupæ; it consists<a name="Page_549" id="Page_549" href="#Page_549"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 549]</span></a>
of only a single almost globular (fig. <a href="#p23f17">17</a>, <i>q</i>) segment, instead of
three segments; and the two caudal appendages (<i>r</i>) are very
long, and are composed each of only a single segment (instead
of two), carrying at its tip two short spines. There are two
purple eyes, 4/3000ths of an inch in diameter, which, after
having been dried and then soaked, could be seen to be
compound; they are fixed in the usual manner to two
rather short apodemes, which latter have their usual origin.
But the pupa has a very unusual appearance owing to the
presence of a single dark purple eye, half the diameter of the
two larger eyes, situated behind and above the latter, and
quite disconnected with the apodemes; this is the eye of the
mature animal, which, for some reason, is here developed
earlier than usual. The prehensile antennæ are remarkable
from being seated very close to the anterior extremity: owing
to this, the articulation of the second or main segment with
the basal segment, is hardly at all oblique. The whole pupa
is of exactly the same length as the pupa of <i>Ibla quadrivalvis</i>,
and so are the antennæ, (see p. 286 of my volume on the
Lepadidæ), viz., 32/6000th of an inch, but the second segment is
narrower, (being only 8/6000ths in breadth in the broadest part),
and is longer in proportion, for the disc which forms part of
the total length is only 4/6000ths in length, whereas in Ibla it
was 8/6000ths; the disc is here hoof-shaped, as in Ibla. The
ultimate segment is remarkably short and narrow, (being
only 3/20000ths in width, and less than half the size of that in
Ibla); it carries (I believe) three terminal spines, and is
not notched. Altogether the antennæ more nearly resemble
those of Ibla than of any other genus in the family. From
the position of the antennæ, and from the length of the
second segment, the pupa, when cemented by the disc or
third segment, to the supporting surface, adheres, with its
posterior end almost vertically upwards. With respect to
the young cirripede within the pupa, I could only observe
that its anterior end was formed into a blunt point.</p>

<p><i>Powers of Excavation; Inorganic Deposit of Calcareous
Matter; Attachment.</i>—<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, according to Mr. Hancock,
attacks only dead shells of the Fusus and Buccinum, and
always on their inner sides, especially on the columella.
The excavations, in the specimen which I examined, were so<a name="Page_550" id="Page_550" href="#Page_550"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 550]</span></a>
numerous as almost to touch, and sometimes to run into each
other, the included animal being thus rendered distorted.
The orifices are directed with respect to the shell indifferently
upwards or downwards. From the shape and size of the
cavity corresponding to that of the included animal, there can
be no doubt, as stated by Mr. Hancock, that <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> forms
its own cavity. That the action is mechanical I think may
safely be inferred from the whole outer membrane being
studded with minute, star-headed points of hard chitine,
which rise from halo-like little discs of thickened membrane,
which latter are well adapted to allow the underlying
adherent muscular layer to act on the points, and thus
on the surrounding shell. Consequently the points generally
show signs of severe attrition, but they are periodically
and often replaced, at each exuviation, by new and much
sharper points. There are no points on the permanently
attached layers of the horny disc, but it particularly deserves
attention, that the renewable membrane always extends
beyond the circumference of the disc, and is there most
thickly studded with the points. We have met, in Lithotrya,
with a precisely analogous fact in the extension of the
periodically moulted membrane of the peduncle, furnished
with star-headed points of chitine, and in addition with
minute calcareous beads (which, however, seem soon worn
away), beyond the calcareous discs, by which this cirripede is
attached in its cavity. We need not feel much surprise at
points of chitine being hard enough to wear away shell, when
we consider what work the jaws of insects, likewise formed
of chitine, will effect.</p>

<p>With respect to the first commencement of the excavation,
the pupa, owing to the position of its prehensile
antennæ, fixes itself with its posterior end almost vertically
upwards; and the young cirripede, after its metamorphosis,
from the greater length of the ventral integuments formed
round the eye-apodemes, must be thrown backwards into
nearly the position represented in Pl. <a href="#Page_706">22</a>, fig. <a href="#p22f12">12</a>, <i>b</i>. I have
not seen a young female at this early age, but I have traced
the development of several males, and have found that the
lower end of the peduncle, (<i>i. e.</i> what was the anterior
end of the pupa), grows at quite a remarkable rate, so as<a name="Page_551" id="Page_551" href="#Page_551"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 551]</span></a>
very soon to form a great bag extending beyond the
attached prehensile antennæ. Now if we suppose an analogous
structure in the female or ordinary <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and the
supposition is quite allowable, we shall almost immediately
have the anterior or lower end of the young cirripede, just
in advance of its antennæ, pressing against the surface of the
shell of the mollusc; and if armed with triturating points,
as we have every reason to believe it is, it would wear for
itself a cavity. The horny disc on the ventral surface of
this protuberant anterior end of the young animal will, we
may assume, soon become cemented to the near side of the
cavity just supposed to have been excavated. And the whole
animal, by further slight changes in direction, namely, by
working down more and more obliquely, will take, as shown
at (<i>c</i>), its final position. As the whole surface of the animal,
with the exception of the horny disc, is provided with triturating
points, the animal, when once imbedded, can and does
increase its cavity at both ends in length, in depth, and
all round the edges of the horny disc,—in short, in every
direction excepting directly over the horny disc. I believe,
as already explained, that the young <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, (<i>b</i>, diagram),
first bores obliquely into the shell; and whatever amount of
downward extension the horny disc attains before the young
cirripede assumes its proper position, with its ventral surface
upwards and parallel to the inner surface of the shell of the
mollusc, that amount determines the thickness of the plate
of shell hereafter to be left unabraded over the horny disc,
as the latter continues to extend in circumference. This
plate of shell over the horny disc is so thin, that, as mentioned
at the commencement, the colour of the ovaria is seen
through; and until I reflected on the following considerations,
I was much surprised how the instinct of the
animal could so neatly guide it not to grind too deeply, and
yet to grind till only a very thin plate of shell was left over
its horny disc: these considerations are, that whatever
thickness was first given to this plate of shell, when the
animal was very young and first assumed its ultimate position,
that thickness would in most cases be always retained,
owing to the flatness of the disc, and to the membrane
armed with triturating points protruding very slightly be<a name="Page_552" id="Page_552" href="#Page_552"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 552]</span></a>yond
and above the horny disc, only just enough to wear
away the surrounding shell to the thickness necessary to
allow of the formation of each new zone of disc; as the disc
itself is not armed, it subsequently has no power of wearing
away the plate of shell above it. Thus the horny disc,
besides giving support and attachment to the peduncle, is
of this peculiar service that it seems to guide, (somewhat
like the wood-part in a plane), the rasping powers of the
lower extreme margin of the peduncle.</p>

<p>I may here observe that certain radiating and often
punctured lines, mentioned and figured by Mr. Hancock,
which help to render the thin plate of shell over the peduncle
conspicuous (fig. <a href="#p22f03">3</a>), are formed by the burrows of an excessively
minute annelid, the punctures being apparently
the exit orifices: I imagine that these annelids find it difficult
to commence their burrows on the smooth surface of the shell,
and that they congregate at these particular spots and
thence burrow in radiating lines, owing to their having
taken advantage of the little cliff-like edges, at the narrow
and disused ends of the fissures leading into the cavities
occupied by the <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, where alone they would not be
disturbed by the action of the cirri, when first they commenced
making their little burrows in the shell.</p>

<p>The fissure leading into the cavity is required to be broad
at the posterior end, in order that the cirri may be there freely
exserted out of the sack; and narrow in other parts, to
prevent, as it would appear, anything injurious getting in
between the animal's body and the cavity in the shell of the
mollusc. As the fissure is increased in length by attrition
at the broad posterior end, which end during growth becomes
broader and broader, the lower part of the fissure has to be
narrowed, and this is effected in a very singular manner,
namely, by advantage being taken of the strong tendency,
which triturated shell with animal matter, has to set into
a solid shelly mass, although <span class="correction" title="In the original book: constanty">constantly</span> agitated.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[147]</span></a> Mr.<a name="Page_553" id="Page_553" href="#Page_553"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 553]</span></a>
Hancock noticed this edging of hard shelly matter, and
naturally thought it was a secretion. Lines of deposition
(Pl. <a href="#Page_706">22</a>, fig. <a href="#p22f04">4</a>, <i>b</i>), parallel to the edges of the furrow
can often be perceived in it: its thickness and extension
vary much: I have seen it on one side alone of the orifice:
it is, of course, never found at the broad end where
the process of enlargement goes on. The peculiar worn
surface with which it irregularly thins away downwards, on
the sides of the cavity, made me (together with the apparent
impossibility of such a secretion proceeding from an animal
wholly invested by a chitine membrane) suspect it to be
inorganic; and this view is certainly correct, for when a
fragment is dissolved in acid, a considerable <span class="correction" title="In the original book: residium">residuum</span> is left
of bits of membrane, rubbish, and, in one instance, even of
the remnants of a foreign animal, apparently an annelid.
We have here all the circumstances favorable for inorganic
deposits of this nature, namely, finely triturated shell and
chitine or animal matter, produced by the excavation of the
chamber, sea-water, and movement.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_147_147" id="Footnote_147_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> I have given some remarkable cases in my volume on 'Volcanic Islands,'
(p. 49), in which limestone, having almost the hardness and specific gravity of
marble, has been thus deposited. Almost every coral-reef offers similar examples.
The curious substance described by Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster,
('Philosoph. Transact.,' 1836, p. 65), which is formed during the manufactory
of cloth, offers another example of the strong tendency which lime and animal
matter have to unite. Lately, Dr. Horsford, in 'Silliman's North American
Journal,' Jan. 1853, has discussed the chemical theory in an analogous case on
the coast of Florida; he attributes the aggregation to the formation of a
hydrate of lime through the action of the animal matter. Mr. G. B. Sowerby,
Junr., has described a case very analogous to that of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, ('Proceedings of
Zoolog. Soc., Mollusca,' Pl. 5, fig. 4, p. 162, 1850), namely, that of <i>Pholas calva</i>,
in which a tube is formed of <em>inorganic</em> calcareous matter, serving to narrow the
entrance.</p></div>

<p>From the manner of growth of the animal, the fissure
leading into the cavity in the shell becomes much longer
than the orifice leading into the sack, and to prevent the
body being unnecessarily exposed, the upward projection of
the disc, already described, is formed under the narrow and
disused end of the fissure; moreover, the two rims of the
inorganic calcareous deposit sometimes here approach so
closely, as almost or actually to touch each other; and
between them, as remarked by Mr. Hancock, there is
usually a little accumulation of grains of sand. This
narrow end of the fissure is generally curled either to the
right or left hand; and I can only account for this fact by
supposing that, whilst the cirripede is young, and has not a<a name="Page_554" id="Page_554" href="#Page_554"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 554]</span></a>
large horny disc attached to the cavity, it cannot keep its
body straight during the long-continued boring process.</p>

<p>The animal is attached by its horny disc to the thin shelly
roof over the peduncle, and likewise to the under side of the
narrow end of the fissure, but is elsewhere quite free. I
carefully examined the disc in many specimens, but could
not see any cement-ducts: I believe I saw layers of cement
at the upper end of the disc, but it is not easy to discriminate
between this substance and the yellowish, somewhat
disintegrated, layers of the horny disc. The pupa certainly
becomes attached by ordinary cement, so that the
attachment in early life, at least, is normal. In some full-grown
specimens, I found the lower parts of the horny disc
attached, along the edges of the layers, to the roof of
shell; and as I looked here in vain with the highest
powers for cement-ducts, or for cement, it appears to me
probable that the rough edges of these layers were
united to the roof by a thin layer of the inorganic calcareous
deposit. The animal, from its very protected situation,
certainly requires to be less firmly cemented than other
cirripedes; and even in Lithotrya, which is less deeply imbedded
than <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, the cementing apparatus was feebly
developed. From the length of the pupal antennæ, cemented
by their terminal segments, the position of the young
cirripede (Pl. <a href="#Page_706">22</a>, fig. <a href="#p22f12">12</a>) can be changed to a considerable
extent, like a ship swinging at her moorings, but in order
to assume its final position, the animal must, I think, travel
like Lithotrya, but to a much less extent, by a short succession
of overlapping horny discs,—the old discs being partially deserted,
each new one extending beyond the last-formed one:
even in the case of the mature animal, we have seen that,
under certain circumstances, it changes, to a certain extent,
its position; portions of the old disc being deserted and
attached to the roof of a deserted portion of the cavity.</p>

<p><i>Affinities.</i>—In the preliminary remarks under the Family,
I have discussed this subject almost sufficiently: I will here
only remark, that the genus, though so abnormal, yet
stands naturally between Ibla and Anelasma, having clear
affinities, on the one side, through and beyond Anelasma to
Alepas; and on the other side, beyond Ibla to Scalpellum,<a name="Page_555" id="Page_555" href="#Page_555"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 555]</span></a>
and so to Lithotrya. Moreover, it is very distinctly related
to <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> in the succeeding Order.</p>

<p>On every specimen of the female <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, which I carefully
examined, I found some minute parasites (or epizoons)
attached to the lateral edges of the upper part of the horny
disc, and therefore lying within the narrow end of the fissure
leading into the chamber excavated in the shell of the
Buccinum. Although having had some experience in the
very anomalous forms which male cirripedes assume, yet
when I first casually inspected these parasites under a weak
lens, from their transparency, their elongated and lobed
body, including an internal folded up organ, I actually threw
them away, thinking that they were probably Bryozoa.
Subsequently, a more careful inspection immediately showed
the cemented prehensile antennæ, and their cirripedial
nature was demonstrated. I soon found specimens with
the perfect still adherent exuviæ of the locomotive pupa,
undistinguishable from the pupa already described as probably
belonging to the female <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>. But as this latter fact,
may perhaps be doubted, I must show that there is other evidence
sufficient to prove that these cirripedial parasites are
the males of the female <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>. Of the females, I inspected
many specimens, and all certainly were without external
male organs; and in the four or five specimens which I
rigidly examined, there were no testes or vesiculæ seminales,
the latter being in all hermaphrodite and male cirripedes
so conspicuous. On the other hand, I examined at
least thirty specimens of the parasite, and they were all
exclusively males, for all had a probosciformed penis, and
the greater number had their vesiculæ seminales filled with
spermatozoa, and hence were ready to perform the act of impregnation,
but undoubtedly they contained no ova. It would,
then, be very strange, if these two cirripedes of opposite sexes,
thus attached together, were not sexually related. Wonderfully
different as the parasite is from the female <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, yet,
in one very important character it is related to <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and to<a name="Page_556" id="Page_556" href="#Page_556"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 556]</span></a>
no other member of the Family, namely, in the sack extending
down to the extreme lower point of the peduncle; the male
organs, I may add, occupying an analogous position with
the peculiar position of the female organs in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>. The
lateral lobes of the peduncle in the parasite seem to represent
the sides of the broad depressed peduncle in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>;
and in both the peduncle grows at its lower end—a very
rare circumstance—observed only in two genera in this
Family, namely, in Anelasma, and in a slight degree in
Lithotrya. Besides these points of resemblance between
<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> and its parasite, which are striking, considering their
external utter dissemblance, the affinities of both point,
judging from certain small characters, in the same direction,
namely, towards Ibla and Alepas. Finally, then, I think,
we may confidently admit that this parasite or epizoon is the
male of the female <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>: indeed, considering the facts
given in my former volume, on Ibla and Scalpellum, I have,
perhaps, here discussed the question at unnecessary length.</p>

<p>The males are generally attached, as already stated, to
the two hollowed out sides of the upward prolongation of
the horny disc; they adhere by means of little patches of
cement, proceeding from the terminal segments of their
antennæ, to the overlapping edges of the few later-formed
zones of the disc; hence, they lie protected, within the
narrow end and a little under the edges of the fissure leading
into the cavity in which the female is lodged. In some
specimens, however, the males are attached rather lower down
on the disc, and are not confined exclusively to its upper
margin, so that they live fairly under the roof of shell which
covers the main part of the disc: but they are never attached
very low down, so as to lie far from the lower end of the
orifice leading into the sack of the female. I have two or
three times seen as many as three males on each side, but
sometimes there is only one on each side, or none on one
side. A large distorted specimen actually had twelve males,
and two pupæ on the point of undergoing their final metamorphosis,
all fourteen attached on one side, and all evidently
must have been alive together! Another specimen
had nearly the same number, a few on one side, and the rest
on the other side.</p>


<p><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557" href="#Page_557"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 557]</span></a></p>

<p>The male immediately, after the exuviation of the pupal
carapace, 25/1000th of an inch in length, is only 23/1000th of an inch
long, but ultimately it becomes, chiefly from the growth of
the lower end of the peduncle, nearly twice this length; for
the largest specimen which I have seen, that figured, was
45/1000th of an inch long (<i>i. e.</i> under 1/20th of an inch), and
1/100th of an inch in breadth across the peduncle, beneath the
lateral lobes. The whole external membrane of the animal
(as well as the internal membrane of the sack), is very thin,
quite structureless, and as transparent as glass; hence, even
the spermatozoa, within the vesicula seminalis, can be seen
from the outside. The whole structure of the animal is
very simple. The ventral surface can be at once recognised
by the attachment of the antennæ (fig. <a href="#p23f19">19</a>, <i>a</i>), and these
organs mark the point which was the anterior end of the
male, just at the period of its metamorphosis, and before the
lower end of the peduncle had grown. These antennæ have
already been fully described; they are conspicuous from
being composed of membrane, rather thicker than that
investing the body of the male, and which external membrane
can be traced entering these organs, and appearing like
cement-ducts; but within these tubular prolongations of the
outer membrane, I could obscurely see the real cement-ducts.</p>

<p>The part answering to the capitulum is much flattened
and elongated; it widens but little from the upper to the lower
end, where it blends with the carinal or dorsal surface
(the under surface in fig. <a href="#p23f19">19</a>) of the lobed peduncle. At the
upper end there is a small orifice, and close to this, on the
ventral or rostral side, there is a thin, apparently double projection
(<i>i</i>, fig. <a href="#p23f19">19</a>) or flap of membrane, one flap lying exactly
over the other. The whole length of this capitulum probably
corresponds with that small portion of the capitulum in the
female, between the upward prolongation of the horny disc
and the lower end of the orifice; and the two broad flattened
projections in the male, probably answer to the two sharp
narrow points (<i>a</i>, fig. <a href="#p22f01">1</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_706">22</a>) in the female. The peduncle
has two lateral lobes (<i>h</i>, <i>g</i>, fig. <a href="#p23f19">19</a>), and, whilst young, what
may be called a third and medial lobe, but this soon increases
largely by growth, and forms the main part of the peduncle.
The lateral lobes are intimately connected with the ventral
surface; they tend to lie in a plane, at right angles to the<a name="Page_558" id="Page_558" href="#Page_558"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 558]</span></a>
compressed capitulum, but owing to the excessive thinness and
flexibility of the whole external membrane, it is difficult to ascertain
the relative position of the different parts. Moreover,
owing to the pupa being so much flattened, these lobes are
necessarily formed folded up; and, I believe, it depends on the
position, with respect to surrounding objects, which the male
ultimately holds, whether the lobes ever assume, their apparently
normal position, in a plane at right angles to the sides
of the pupa; owing, also, to the form of the pupa, the two
lobes seem generally to be actually formed of unequal sizes,
that formed in the dorsal region of the pupa being the largest.
I believe that these lobes correspond with the lateral margins
of the upper end of the peduncle of the female, which margins
project laterally beyond the sides of the capitulum. The
lower lobe, or end of the peduncle, is depressed in the same
plane with the lobes; it is of variable length; when first
formed it hardly extends beyond the basal articulation of
the prehensile antennæ. Commonly it does not lie quite in
a straight line of the capitulum; and I have seen specimens
in which it stood at nearly right angles to the
capitulum and to what was the ventral surface of the pupa;
this irregularity in the relative position and sizes of the
different parts of the peduncle, no doubt, to a considerable
extent, depends on the form of surface to which the male
becomes attached, just in the same way as we have seen
that the peduncle of the female becomes altered in shape
during the excavation of the chamber in which it is lodged.</p>

<p>I feel some difficulty on one point: in the pupa the single
eye of the future male can be clearly distinguished, and it
lies some way from the anterior end of the body; but in two
males, which certainly had just moulted, and in which none
of the internal organs were as yet developed, the eye lay close
to the anterior end, directly over the basal articulation of
the antennæ. I suspect this is somehow caused by the
great change of form which supervenes, during the metamorphosis,
at this anterior end of the body; the extremely compressed
body of the pupa having to become depressed and
lobed in the young male. I have given a figure of a young
male, just as it appeared (Pl. <a href="#Page_707">23</a>, fig. <a href="#p23f18">18</a>), somewhat distorted
from lying on a flat surface; <i>c</i>, being the eye.</p>

<p>The sack extends, in a very remarkable manner, down to<a name="Page_559" id="Page_559" href="#Page_559"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 559]</span></a>
the lower end of the peduncle, the whole inside of the animal
being thus freely open to the water. In the upper part, the
sack forms a mere narrow tube; it does not appear to have
been formed in the same manner as in all other cirripedes,
namely, surrounding the thorax and natatory legs of the
pupa, but in an abnormal position, along the dorsal surface,
above the sack and thorax of the pupa: a transparent line,
where the new narrow sack is in process of formation, is
the first indication of the coming metamorphosis. The
sack in the capitulum of the male is not central, but lies
near the dorsal surface; the ventral interspace, between
the outside and the sack, is occupied by oblique fibres
(<i>l</i>, fig. <a href="#p23f19">19</a>), which may be striæ-less muscles, but I suspect
are ligamentous fibres, giving support to the whole
projecting capitulum. These fibres enter a little way
within the lobed peduncle; they are probably homologous
with the strong muscles, which run from beneath the
upper end of the horny disc of the female to the lower end
of the orifice leading into the sack. Round the lobed
peduncle,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[148]</span></a> there are two bands (<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>) of thin muscular
fasciæ, slightly oblique to each other, and attached at the
ends to the outer membrane; they are evidently homologous
with the external transverse muscles, which are best developed
round the same part in the female. Some of these
muscles present a singular chain-like appearance, from being
strangled at intervals: they act probably in aiding the long
probosciformed penis to protrude itself out of the sack. I
could not detect any longitudinal muscles, and the lower
part of the peduncle seems destitute of muscles of any kind.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_148_148" id="Footnote_148_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148_148"><span class="label">[148]</span></a> I believe I saw in one specimen, most delicate transverse muscular fibres
round the lower part of the elongated capitulum.</p></div>

<p>The internal structure of the animal is very simple.
Within the lower end of the peduncle there is a dark purple
eye (<i>c</i>), under the 1/1000th of an inch in diameter, a testis (<i>d</i>)
and a (<i>b</i>) vesicula seminalis. These organs falsely appear as if
suspended in the middle of the peduncle, but they are really
attached, I believe within a separate partition, to the
ventral surface, occupying the same position as the mass of
ovarian cæca in the female. The eye lies on the line of
junction between the testis and the vesicula seminalis, and<a name="Page_560" id="Page_560" href="#Page_560"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 560]</span></a>
on their ventral side. The testis is rounded, and consists
of a mass of cells, on an average 1/5000th of an inch in diameter.
The vesicula seminalis varies extremely in condition,
being either a mere rather broad vessel, enlarged where it
joins the testis, or a bag fully as large as the testis itself,
and distended with spermatozoa, all arranged parallel to its
longer axis. There was an evident relation between the size of
the vesicula seminalis and that of the testis, the number of the
cells in the latter decreasing as the mass of the spermatozoa
increased: there was also an evident relation between the
age of the male and the state of these organs; younger and
more opaque individuals, having their testes of large size;
and older specimens, with the lower end of the peduncle
arrived at its full dimensions, having the vesicula distended.
Some few old specimens had evidently discharged their
spermatozoa. By dissection I more than once distinctly
traced the vesicula seminalis entering the broad lower end
of the penis. The membrane, forming the vesicula, is
ringed, and I presume is, as in other cirripedes, contractile,
so as to expel the spermatozoa. The probosciformed penis
(<i>m</i>) is of extraordinary length: it is plainly ringed, or rather
articulated, in this respect resembling that organ in Ibla and
Alepas; it tapers gradually, and terminates (as usual) with
a brush of fine bristles; it is furnished with delicate voluntary
muscles, arising from the body round its basis, and
extending no doubt up to the apex, but too fine to be traced
all the way. Its broad lower end is attached in a slight depression,
on the ventral side of the sack, a little above the point
of attachment of the pupal antennæ. According to all analogy,
the spot whence the penis springs must be considered as representing
the thorax and abdomen; and the outer membrane
of the penis is here, as on this view it should be, reflexed and
is continuous with that lining the sack. Ordinarily the penis
lies coiled up in complicated folds, appearing like a large intestinal
worm, and fills the lobed part of the peduncle, which
apparently serves for no other purpose than its reception. In
one case in which I dissected out the penis, I found it in
its contracted state; 41/1000th of an inch in length, equal to that
of the entire capitulum and peduncle; in a specimen, in
which the penis had been naturally exserted, the part which<a name="Page_561" id="Page_561" href="#Page_561"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 561]</span></a>
protruded (<i>m</i>) was by itself rather longer than the whole
animal; and as this specimen had been placed in spirits of
wine, the organ no doubt was contracted; hence I think it
probable that the probosciformed penis, when fully stretched
out, would equal twice the length of the entire animal.</p>

<p>There must be a nervous system; and there must likewise
be a gland (homologous with the ovaria) for secreting
the cement; but I could not distinguish parts so small.
Certainly there is no mouth, or stomach, or thorax, or
limbs of any kind, or abdomen.</p>

<p>It is obvious that these males must be very short-lived:
they perform their masculine functions and then perish.
We have seen, however, that after the act of metamorphosis
they do grow a little, and I have reason to suspect
that this is effected, as with other Cirripedes, by moulting.
The growth must be absolutely dependent on the store of
nutriment laid up within the pupa. The young male, immediately
after the exuviation of the integuments, thorax,
natatory legs, abdomen, and eyes of the pupa, consists of
a pulpy cellular mass, without any internal organs as yet
formed.</p>

<p>Judging from the different sizes of the females which
included perfectly developed ova, I infer that they must
breed more than once during their lives; and therefore, that
successive sets of males, as in the genus Scalpellum, must
become attached to them. I was not, however, able to discover
the prehensile antennæ or other remains of the old
males adherent to the females; a circumstance which I presume
is accounted for by their attachment being weak.
Considering the very small size of the male, it is not surprising
that so many,—in one case fourteen,—are required
to impregnate the numerous ova of a single female. How
the males know the proper period when the ova, lying in a
sheet at the very base of the sack of the female, are ready
for impregnation, I cannot say, without it be that they perceive
the moulting of the external membrane, close to the
edge of which they are attached; for this moulting would
indicate the period when the ovigerous lamella came to the
surface of the sack, and the ova would then be soon ready for
impregnation. From the position in which the males are<a name="Page_562" id="Page_562" href="#Page_562"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 562]</span></a>
attached, and from the extraordinary length of the probosciformed
penis, capable of voluntary movements, I have no
doubt the males can insert the tip of this organ within the
lower edge of the orifice of the sack, and there discharge
the spermatozoa, which, by their own movements, must
pass down the sides of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: sack of female">sack of the female</span> till they reach
their proper destination. The position of the males, with
respect to the female's body, is almost exactly the same as
that occupied by the complemental males of <i>Scalpellum
Peronii</i> and <i>villosum</i>; the lower and narrow end of the fissure,
worn in the gasteropod shell, here affording that protection
to the males, which the edges of the opposed scuta afford
to the <em>complemental</em> males of the above two species of Scalpellum.
We cannot doubt that these latter males aid in the
impregnation of the ova of the hermaphrodites, but they are
not furnished with a very long penis, probably for the very
reason that they are <em>complemental</em> males, and therefore not
so absolutely necessary for the impregnation of the ova as
are the males of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>.</p>

<p>I have, in my former volume, expressed my astonishment
at the extent to which abortion had been carried in the
male Ibla; but it has been carried much further in the
male <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>. In Ibla, the thorax is reduced to a mere
flap, and only two pairs of cirri exist in a most useless and
rudimentary state, but there is a well organised mouth,
stomach, and anus. In the males of <i>Scalpellum vulgare</i>,
<i>ornatum</i>, and <i>rutilum</i> there is no mouth or stomach, but there
is a thorax with four pairs of minute, modified cirri, and a
large abdominal lobe. Here, in the male <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, all these
negatives are united, we have no mouth, no stomach, no
thorax, no cirri, no abdomen! The archetype crustacean
consists of twenty-one segments; of these the seventeen
anterior segments can be clearly made out in the archetype
Cirripede: now, in the male <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, the first three
segments are largely developed, forming all that is externally
visible, but the remaining fourteen segments are
absolutely aborted, but in idea may be considered as forming
the membranous depression whence the probosciformed
penis springs; for this organ normally arises at the extremity
of the seventeenth segment. To show the wonderful<a name="Page_563" id="Page_563" href="#Page_563"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 563]</span></a>
diversity of nature, even in the same sub-class, I may be
permitted to remark, that whilst in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> only the three
anterior segments are developed, the fourteen succeeding
segments being rudimentary, in <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> (hereafter to be
described) these fourteen segments are all largely developed,
whilst the three anterior segments are quite aborted, being
represented only by a thin envelope to the two threads by
which this Cirripede is attached to the supporting object.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[149]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Cirripedia, having a flask-shaped carapace; body consisting
of one cephalic, seven thoracic, and three abdominal
segments; the latter bearing three pairs of cirri; the thoracic
segments without limbs; mouth with the labrum
greatly produced, and capable of independent movements;
œsophagus armed with teeth at its lower end: larva, firstly
egg-like, without external limbs or an eye; lastly binocular,
without thoracic legs, but with abdominal appendages.</i></p>


<p class="p2">I feel compelled to form an Order for the one genus and
species, namely, <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus"><i>Cryptophialus minutus</i></a>, to be here described.
We must, I conceive, attribute much greater value, in classification,
to internal parts and organs, at least where such
are not known to vary, than to external structure. Now in
<a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, the body consists of eight segments, of which
the first two are not developed in any cirripede hitherto
described. Of the eight, the seven posterior or thoracic
segments are quite free, or detached from the carapace, and
do not bear any appendages; whereas in all the foregoing
cirripedes of the order Thoracica there are (at least in the
normal sex) six pairs of cirri; <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> alone must be excepted,
in which there are only two pairs. Again, in the
<a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a> there are no abdominal appendages, excepting
the terminal or caudal, whereas in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> the abdomen
bears three pairs of biramous cirri. In the crest of<a name="Page_564" id="Page_564" href="#Page_564"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 564]</span></a>
the labrum, being produced into a special, lancet-formed
organ, articulated at its base and capable of movement,
and in the palpi projecting straight upwards, we have a
great difference from all other cirripedes; and these
organs, we have every reason to believe, possess a high
classificatory importance. The œsophagus in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>,
where it enters the stomach, is armed with teeth and
hairs, moved by muscles, forming a beautiful structure, of
which we have not a trace in any other cirripede. Lastly,
and perhaps most importantly of all, the metamorphosis is
different; for the early larval stages are passed under an
egg-like condition within the sack of the parent; and
the pupa differs from the pupæ of all other cirripedes, in
not having natatory thoracic limbs, and is therefore only able
to crawl about by the aid of its great prehensile antennæ.</p>

<p>Thus far the evidence is decisive in favour of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>
being placed in a separate Order; but if we were
to trust to the characters derived from the external covering
or carapace,—and such characters are of high importance,
as we may safely infer from the natural arrangement of the
foregoing families which depends on the structure of the
carapace,—we should place <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> close to <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: amonst">amongst</span> the Lepadidæ. These genera agree in their burrowing
habits,—in their attachment by a horny rostral disc,—in
the external membrane being covered with triturating
points,—in the spinose and notched orifice, with an external
lateral bar on each side, and in the inner tunic of the sack
being protected by hairs and spines. They agree to a considerable
extent in shape, and in the peculiar arrangement
of the muscles of the whole external covering of the animal:
they agree, also, in their manner of growth, and in the sack
extending down to their basal extremity. Some of these
resemblances may possibly be analogical, and due to similarity
of habits, and not to affinity; and we must attribute
to mere similarity in function, a certain amount of resemblance
in their labrums, for this part is essentially different
in the two genera; and to the same cause, the resemblance
between the brush formed by the two pairs of thoracic cirri and
caudal appendages at the end of part of the thorax in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>,
with the three pairs of abdominal cirri at the end of the<a name="Page_565" id="Page_565" href="#Page_565"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 565]</span></a>
whole thorax in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>. I allude to this latter resemblance,
for it was owing to it, and to the similarity in
the habits of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> and <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, that I stated, in
the introduction to my former volume on the Lepadidæ, that
the two genera would probably fall into the same order.
In the structure of all the parts of the mouth and of the
cirri, in the digestive organs and in the metamorphoses,
<a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> is not more closely related to <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> than to
any other genus whatever amongst the Lepadidæ.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I am confirmed in the view that the external
resemblances between these two genera are due to some
real affinity, and are not merely analogical, by a very remarkable
fact,—namely, that <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> and <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>
are both bisexual, and have males, several in number, attached
exactly in the same position, and which males are
so closely similar that, considered by themselves, they might
absolutely be almost classed as species of the same genus!
For they agree in the absence of all internal organs and
parts, excepting the single testis, vesicula seminalis, and
immensely long probosciformed penis; and they agree, also
in manner of growth, in the arrangement of the muscles,
and even in shape. The whole case seems to me very singular,
and, as far as my knowledge extends, unique: we have two
animals, of which the females, if classed by their external
parts (homologically consisting of the three anterior segments
of the head), would be placed alongside each other
in the same family; but when classed by the whole rest
of their organisation, certainly must be ranked in distinct
orders;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[150]</span></a> yet the males of these very same animals
might almost stand in the same genus. If it be asked<a name="Page_566" id="Page_566" href="#Page_566"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 566]</span></a>
why the position of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> in the system should
not be determined by the male, instead of by the female,
the answer would be that the male is here abnormal
and rudimentary in its whole structure; and I believe
systematists are agreed that less perfect parts (and therefore
a less perfect whole) offer less valuable characters
than the more perfect parts or whole. We see this conclusion
plainly verified in the case of the hermaphrodite
<i>Scalpellum vulgare</i> and <i>Ibla quadrivalvis</i>, for there can be
no doubt where these species should be arranged, yet if we
attempted to place them by their complemental males, we
should utterly fail: exactly in the same manner, if <i>Ibla
Cumingii</i> and <i>Scalpellum ornatum</i> were ranked by their males,
they would be quite misplaced. So again, if we were to
attempt to class the six species of Scalpellum by their males
and complemental males, undoubtedly the first three and last
three species of the genus would have to stand in distinct
orders! Hence we may reject the males as a foundation for
classification, but no doubt they serve to show that the resemblances
in the carapaces of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> and <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>,
are not merely analogical or functional, but evince a true
affinity, though these genera differ so greatly, in mouth,
body, œsophagus, cirri, and especially in their metamorphoses.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_150_150" id="Footnote_150_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_150_150"><span class="label">[150]</span></a> M. Milne Edwards would, perhaps, in accordance with the profound views
lately propounded by him on classification, consider <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> as an
extremely modified, and, to a certain extent, degraded member or satellite of
the <em>type</em> of the Lepadidæ; but I do not myself feel able to draw a line of distinction
between the being a very abnormal member of one group, and belonging
to a distinct group. I may add that I have several times tried to persuade
myself, with no success, into the belief that I have somehow misunderstood the
homologies of the thoracic segments and cirri of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> and <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>;
for if this were so, the two genera could be brought into much closer relationship;
but with any conceivable amount of error on my part, there remains the
great difference in the metamorphosis, not to mention the palpable differences
in the cirri, the parts of the mouth, and in the whole course of the alimentary
canal.</p></div>

of the narrow sides of this carapace is somewhat flattened or<a name="Page_567" id="Page_567" href="#Page_567"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 567]</span></a>
depressed, with its superior edge prolonged a little upwards;
by this side, the animal is attached to the cavity in the shell,
within which it is lodged. There is here no distinction
between a peduncle and capitulum, that is between the
lower or anterior, and the upper or posterior end of the
animal, as seen externally. The small orifice is toothed and
hairy: it is coloured purple, as is likewise the projecting
labrum; the rest of the animal being tinted only by the
muscles and internal parts seen through the outer integuments.
The largest specimen (fig. <a href="#p23f02">2</a>) which I have measured
did not quite attain the length of one tenth of an inch.
This cirripede inhabits, in vast numbers, the shells of the
living Concholepas Peruviana, amongst the Chonos islands;
the whole outside of the shell being sometimes completely
drilled by its cavities, almost touching each other, as happens
in the case of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> with the shells of Buccinum.
The oval aperture leading into the shell-cavity, in full-sized
specimens, is between (2-3)/100 of an inch in length: it is generally
surrounded by a narrow, internal, calcareous rim,
which apparently has the same inorganic origin, as in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>.
The toothed orifice of the carapace leading into the sack,
fills up the orifice of the shell-cavity; but it can be voluntarily
withdrawn a little: when opened, and the animal is
in action, the lancet-formed, moveable crest of the labrum,
and the abdominal cirri, are exserted.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_151_151" id="Footnote_151_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_151_151"><span class="label">[151]</span></a> I am greatly indebted to Dr. Hooker, for having several years ago, when
I examined this my first cirripede, aided me in many ways, and shown me how
to dissect the more difficult parts, and for having made for me several very
correct drawings, which, with some subsequent alterations, are now engraved.</p></div>

<p><i>Integuments.</i>—The external membrane is colourless, thin,
but strong; it is studded with minute bifid, trifid, and
quadrifid points of hard chitine, which are the agents of
excavation: they are directed upwards, except towards the
lower end, where they are directed from the disc or surface of
attachment. These points beneath the orifice, and on each
side close along the lateral bar, are larger than elsewhere.
There are no points on the disc or surface of attachment, which
is formed of somewhat thickened, yellowish membrane, and
is not moulted, like the rest of the external membrane, but
is formed of successive layers extending beyond each other;
the lines of growth, however, being obscure, and only occasionally
distinguishable. The disc is oval, not extending
to the lower end of the animal, and with the upper edge thinning
out and produced upwards (fig. <a href="#p23f01">1</a>). The animal, during<a name="Page_568" id="Page_568" href="#Page_568"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 568]</span></a>
its growth, moves a little downwards in its cavity, by means
of the new layers of the attached disc being formed, not
symmetrically with respect to the old layers, but beyond
them or at a greater depth in the shell; hence when the
animal is removed quite perfect, by the Concholepas being
dissolved in acid, the upper and deserted margin of the
disc or surface of attachment generally projects as a free
edge, but in a tattered and worn condition. In full
grown specimens, which have ceased burrowing downwards,
nearly the whole disc, though occupying the same position
relatively to the animal, becomes in fact deserted, and is
lined by membrane continuous with, and like that, investing
the rest of the body, but furnished only with simple blunt
points, instead of with the sharp bifid and trifid triturating
points.</p>

<p>The orifice is formed on each side by a toothed rim of
hard chitine (fig. <a href="#p23f03">3</a>, <a href="#p23f04">4</a>), which can be opened and shut, owing
to its being flexible at the rostral end, and folded inwards
at the carinal or posterior end. The teeth vary in arrangement
and sharpness: generally they form, taking a rim on
one side (fig. <a href="#p23f03">3</a>), two prominences or groups of points at the
rostral or anterior end, always separated by a broad notch,
from the bottom of which the lateral bar extends downwards,
from the posterior, larger and less regularly toothed
half of the rim. Of these teeth the larger ones project
nearly straight up, and the smaller and lower teeth outwards,
graduating into the smaller teeth, just below the rim, which
again graduate into the minute points, studded over the
whole surface. These outer teeth probably serve to prevent
any creature crawling into the cavity, between the shell and
animal. Scattered bristles rise from all over the rim. The
lateral bar, above alluded to, consists of the general membrane
of the body, thickened, hardened, rendered elastic,
coloured yellow, and apparently formed into a fold: where
attached to the under side of the rim, at the above-mentioned
notch, the bar is thinner and more flexible than elsewhere:
it runs half way down the animal, first straight and
then curved towards and closely approaching the disc or
surface of attachment. At the lower end, the bar, or more
strictly the thickened membranous margin of the bar (<i>b′</i>,<a name="Page_569" id="Page_569" href="#Page_569"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 569]</span></a>
fig. <a href="#p23f03">3</a>), expands into an oblong, slightly rigid plate, studded
with from three or four to ten or twelve points, which have
their ends expanded and truncated, or even slightly bifid.
The extremity of this plate projects freely from the general
surface of the body. We shall afterwards refer to the use
of this extremely peculiar bar and plate.</p>

<p>The two rims forming the orifice cannot be quite closed;
but ingress by any foreign object into the sack is beautifully
prevented by an internal membranous lip on each side (<i>d′</i>,
fig. <a href="#p23f03">3</a>, <a href="#p23f04">4</a>), and by a third inwardly folded lip (<i>d′</i>) at the posterior
and broad end of the orifice. These three lips can be
brought together, and form a valve. The lateral lips are very
narrow at the mouth or rostral end of the orifice, where the
hairy lancet-shaped crest of the labrum closes the orifice, and
largely expand towards the posterior end: they are produced
from the inner tunic of the sack: they appear formed
of the finest hairs, placed parallel and approximate, but when
examined under the highest powers, these hairs (for they
still appear such) are found to be united by delicate membrane,
which has its extreme edge fimbriated. The third,
or posterior and inwardly folded lip, differs in being composed
of much coarser, flattened hairs, which are united
towards their bases, and are free at their extremities, where
they are serrated or coarsely plumose on both sides.</p>

<p>The sack extends down to the lower end of the animal.
It is lined by delicate membrane. At the orifice on each
side, a little posteriorly to the lateral external bars, this
inner membrane is strengthened by a pair of thin yellowish
bars (<i>c′</i>, fig. <a href="#p23f03">3</a>), which run parallel to the straight
portions of the external bars. These inner bars at their
lower ends become pointed and die out: at their upper
ends, and close to the rim, they are broader, but more
flexible, and so transparent as hardly to be distinguished
from the rest of the membrane. At the rostral end of the
orifice, in a medial line, this same inner tunic of the sack is
thickened for a short space downwards, so as to form a fifth
bar (<i>c′′</i>); which separating from the inner tunic, runs inwards
between the outer and inner membranes of the carapace
(<i>i. e.</i> between <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, fig. <a href="#p23f03">3</a>, <a href="#p23f05">5</a>), behind the mouth, as far
down as opposite to the lower end of the œsophagus, and<a name="Page_570" id="Page_570" href="#Page_570"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 570]</span></a>
there becoming thinner and ligamentous, gives attachment
to some powerful muscles.</p>

<p>At each exuviation, the external membrane with the dentated
hardened orifice, the lateral bars, the inner tunic of the
sack with its bars, are all moulted, together with the usual
integuments of the animal's body. New and sharp triturating
points are thus periodically formed for the work of excavation.
The whole animal increases during growth in every
direction, and therefore, at its lower or basal end, as was
the case with <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>. The disc or surface of attachment,
is added to by new underlying layers, extending beyond
the old layers at the lower end and on the sides, but not
at the upper end, where, as in the case of the calcareous discs
of Lithotrya, the old layers are deserted and worn away. I
saw what I believed to be little globules or patches of cement;
but I was not able to discover any cement-ducts.</p>

<p><i>Muscles of Sack and Orifice.</i>—The animal is surrounded
by rather strong longitudinal muscles, not running up close
to the orifice: these muscles exhibited, to my surprise, distinct
traces of transverse striæ: there are no external transverse
muscles, as in all the Lepadidæ. Attached to both sides
of the inward fold or hinge, at the posterior end of the
orifice, some striated or voluntary muscles run for a short
distance downwards, diverging like a fan: their contraction
would cause the dentated rim to open: a strictly homologous
muscle occurs only in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>. At the opposite end
of the orifice, a remarkably powerful voluntary muscle is
attached to the ligamentous bar above described as proceeding
from the rostro-medial end of the toothed rim
(<i>c′′</i>); and at its lower expanded end, it is attached under
rather above the middle of the disc: this muscle corresponds
with a similar one in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and with some
much weaker muscles in other Lepadidæ. Its action would
be to draw down within the shell-cavity the whole dentated
rim, and likewise to close the orifice; and here, I
believe, come into use the lateral elastic horny bars with
their curious basal projecting plates, furnished with expanded
points, for much friction would thus be caused by,
yet some play be allowed for, the several movements; the
elasticity of the bar bringing up the dentated orifice, when<a name="Page_571" id="Page_571" href="#Page_571"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 571]</span></a>
the powerful muscles attached to the rostral end of the latter
became relaxed. Round the space where the just-mentioned
muscles are attached to the horny disc, a sheet of other
muscles radiate, a few on both sides obliquely upwards, but
the greater number transversely and within the first-described
longitudinal muscles; they extend on both sides about half
round the animal. There are similar muscles in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>,
but not extending so far round the animal. Their action
must be to draw the whole carapace towards the surface of
attachment; the action of the longitudinal muscles being to
shorten it; the orifice supported by the lateral horny bars,
serving as the fulcrum for the contraction of the longitudinal
muscles. I could not see any adductor scutorum muscle,
although I looked particularly under the expanded plates at
the ends of the lateral external horny bars.</p>

<p><i>Body.</i>—This is laterally compressed: it is widest and
thickest at the upper end, and thence tapers to the lower
or posterior end. The last three or four thoracic segments
are bent under the anterior segments, giving the whole
something of the appearance of certain crustaceans, divested
of their legs. The somewhat conical mouth, with its singular
labrum, is very large. The body consists of eight segments.
The first segment (fig. <a href="#p23f05">5</a>, <sup>1</sup>), or that succeeding the
mouth, is the seventh or last cephalic segment of the archetype
crustacean; it is the largest of all eight segments; it is
joined by its dorsal surface to the carapace or external
covering of the animal, and the membrane with which it is
invested is prolonged upwards and downwards (<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, fig. <a href="#p23f05">5</a>),
and so forms the inner tunic of the sack. The succeeding
seven segments are thoracic; they are free, and are destitute
of limbs; the articulations separating them are transverse.
The first and second thoracic segments give rise, on their
medial dorsal surfaces, each to a remarkable tapering curved
appendage, presently to be described. At the end of the
last thoracic segment, there is a minute abdomen, bearing
three pairs of biramous cirri.</p>

<p>The <i>Mouth</i> consists of three pairs of organs, namely, the
outer maxillæ, maxillæ, mandibles with their palpi, and of
a great and very curious labrum. These organs, by the fusion
(as in other cirripedes) of their lower segments, form a large,<a name="Page_572" id="Page_572" href="#Page_572"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 572]</span></a>
somewhat conical, projecting mouth, which is separated on
the ventral surface from the rest of the body by a distinct
fold or articulation, where the muscles proceeding to the above
gnathites are attached. The labrum (<i>e</i>, fig. <a href="#p23f05">5</a>, <a href="#p23f09">9</a>) is of large
size; and the crest close over the opening of the œsophagus
is produced into a great, lancet-shaped, moveable organ,
wholly unlike anything occurring in any other cirripede:
it is coloured purple, and is thickly fringed in the upper part
by very fine hairs: it is bowed a little backwards from the
mouth: the base, which rather overhangs the œsophagus,
is a little contracted, and is transversely marked by an
articulation: two small, parallel, voluntary muscles (with
transverse striæ) are attached at their lower ends close
beneath the articulation, and extend about one third up the
organ: their contraction would serve to erect it; and their
relaxation would, apparently, allow it to fall backwards on
a little knob (<i>e′</i>, fig. <a href="#p23f05">5</a>) behind. This little knob resembles
a similar projection in many of the Lepadidæ. As the
labrum is formed of similar membrane with that of the succeeding
segment of the body, its limit downward, beneath
the knob, can be told only by a small apodeme which projects
inwards, at a little distance within the line where the
membrane of the body is reflexed upwards (<i>c</i>), so as to form
the inner tunic of the sack.</p>

<p>The mandibles, palpi, and maxillæ, all project more than
is usual. The <i>Palpi</i> (<i>f</i>, fig. <a href="#p23f09">9</a>, <a href="#p23f05">5</a>) are narrow, flattened, and
taper a little; they support a few long bristles on their tips,
and on one of their sides. In every other cirripede (in which
the palpi are developed) they are directed transversely across
the mouth, one towards the other, and are for a considerable
space united to the labrum: here they project straight up,
and seem to rise exteriorly to the bases of the mandibles;
they are, however, united to the basal lateral edges of the
labrum, and when the latter is torn from the rest of the
mouth, the palpi separate with it. I could not distinguish
the knob on which, in every other cirripede, the palpi are
articulated. The <i>Mandibles</i> (fig. <a href="#p23f08">8</a>) have an upper, lower,
and middle tooth, with some finer intermediate points and
hairs. The <i>Maxillæ</i> (fig. <a href="#p23f07">7</a>) are narrowed in at their spinose
edge, where there are three large spines and several finer<a name="Page_573" id="Page_573" href="#Page_573"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 573]</span></a>
bristles, together forming a flattened brush: this organ is
remarkable from the apodeme (<i>a</i>) being bent into the shape
of a scythe, with the terminal or blade-portion a little expanded,
and directed backwards and inwards. The <i>Outer
maxillæ</i> are sub-triangular in outline, with several bristles on
their summits and along their outer surfaces.</p>

<p><i>Segments of Body.</i>—I have stated that the mouth is
succeeded by eight segments. As in all the cirripedes
hitherto described, the body consists of only six segments,
the number eight at first seems very improbable, and therefore
I may be permitted to state that both Dr. Hooker and
myself, when first examining this animal, and having no
notion whatever regarding its homologies or the structure
of other cirripedes, came to the conclusion, judging only
from external appearances, that is, from the transverse
folds, and from the lines of movement when the body was
bent by a needle, that there were really eight segments. I
have since carefully looked to this point: when the outer
membrane is cleaned and examined, the four posterior segments
are very plain, owing to a dorsal medial line, being
alternately either thickened and coloured yellowish, or thin
and colourless: the four anterior segments are less plain,
but yet the membrane on the dorsal surface, on the line of
each fold or articulation, does present some difference, from
being destitute of the fine, transverse, toothed scales which
occur on other parts. But I lay most stress on the fact, that
all these eight articulations were used for the attachment
of muscles. Hence I conclude that the eight segments are
real; and we shall see, in the next order, that the very same
eight segments are as plain in <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, as in the larva
of an insect or as in an annelid. There is good reason to
believe that the general covering or carapace consists in all
cirripedes of the three anterior segments, and that the mouth
(judging from its appendages) also consists of three segments,
consequently the first segment of the body in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>
must be the seventh or last cephalic segment, and the seven
next free segments must be the normal seven thoracic segments.</p>

<p>The first segment of the body (<i>i. e.</i> last cephalic, fig. <a href="#p23f05">5</a>, <sup>1</sup>)
is, as stated, the largest, and is attached dorsally to the<a name="Page_574" id="Page_574" href="#Page_574"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 574]</span></a>
carapace: its ventral surface is flattened, and is formed of
somewhat thickened membrane: on each side, a little below
the articulation separating this segment from the mouth,
there is a small blunt projection, with the free part only
1/500th of an inch in length. Each of these appendages bears
four or five bristles on one side near the summit, and a few
on the other side, lower down: from their position I believe
them to be rudiments of a first pair of maxillipeds
(tetartognathites of Milne Edwards), of which no trace occurs
in any other cirripede. The differences between this segment
and the seven succeeding segments, is of interest, as
offering some confirmation of the belief, lately disputed by
some naturalists, that the cephalic and thoracic segments in
the class Crustacea, do differ in their nature,—a conclusion
which we shall see further confirmed under <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>.
The second and third (<i>i. e.</i> first and second thoracic) segments
(<sup>2</sup>, <sup>3</sup>, fig. <a href="#p23f05">5</a>) are the next largest, and are remarkable
from supporting singular appendages, already alluded to.
The sides of the second segment are formed of thickened
yellowish membrane. The fifth and sixth segments are the
smallest, and mark the point of chief flexure of the body.
The eighth segment is a little elongated, formed of thicker
membrane than the other segments, and dorsally is indented
by the anus.</p>

<p>The singular tapering appendages (fig. <a href="#p23f05">5</a>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>) arising dorsally
from the second and third segments, differ from each
other only by the upper one being smaller, less curled, and
perhaps rather smoother. When first examining this animal,
not knowing that it was female, and not finding a probosciformed
penis, I concluded that these organs were of
this nature,—an excusable mistake, considering their
almost ringed structure, their somewhat constricted bases,
the direction of their curvature, and their position in the
midst of the ova within the sack. On careful examination,
however, these appendages are seen not to be truly ringed
or articulated, but are covered with transverse lines of
scales, hirsute on their edges; these scales being less distinct,
or even quite absent on the smooth upper portion;
they do not include any muscles; they are imperforate
at the apex, which is not furnished with bristles (as seems<a name="Page_575" id="Page_575" href="#Page_575"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 575]</span></a>
always to be the case with the probosciformed penis);
and, lastly, they are lined by corium, but are not occupied
by any vessel, gland, or organ of any kind. The only
function which I can assign to these appendages, is that of
aiding the retention of the ova within the sack: for the ova,
when first produced, are aggregated round them; at this
period I several times observed long, somewhat curled, very
thin fibres, not tapering like hairs, adhering to both appendages,
the nature of which fibres I cannot explain. In
very many cirripedes there seems a strong tendency to the
production of tapering, filamentary appendages, somewhat
like the two (<i>i</i>, <i>k</i>) here described,—namely, at the bottom of
the sack in some <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, at the bases of the anterior cirri in
Lepas and in some other genera, and on the dorsal surface
of the prosoma in certain species of Pollicipes; in this latter
case some of these appendages were covered by scales; and
the prosoma whence they arose answers to the third segment
of the body in <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, or that supporting the
lower and larger appendage. Appendages of this nature,
in several cirripedes, serve for the lodgment of the testes,
but in some cases they are of no apparent use, excepting,
perhaps, in aiding respiration by the expansion of corium
thus exposed, and this partially may be their function here,
for there are no proper branchiæ.</p>

<p><i>Cirri.</i>—There are three pairs, together forming a nearly
straight brush, of considerable length, projecting in a line
with the last thoracic segment. Each cirrus is biramous.
In a moderately large specimen there were twenty segments
in one of the longest rami. Each segment (fig. <a href="#p24f14">14</a>, <i>a</i>) is
strengthened by a dorsal or posterior shield of thickened
yellowish membrane, from the upper edge of which a single
smooth spine projects; the anterior surface is likewise
strengthened on the two edges by thickened membrane,
and supports two pairs of long spines, which are plumose,
or rather hirsute, on both sides. In the lower segments
of both rami of the several cirri, the inner spine of each
pair is considerably shorter than the outer spine,—evidently
in relation to the little power of divergence of the two
rami. All the cirri resemble each other, excepting that the
rami of the anterior pair, are rather shorter than those<a name="Page_576" id="Page_576" href="#Page_576"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 576]</span></a>
of the other cirri, but the dorsal spines on their segments
are longer. In all ordinary cirripedes the two rami are
equally supported by the upper segment of the pedicel,
which latter is very short compared with the lower segment,
and is separated from it by a transverse articulation. Here
(fig. <a href="#p24f13">13</a>) the exterior or anterior ramus is articulated on the
pedicel, almost like a branch, in front of the other ramus,
which seems more directly continuous with the pedicel.
The upper segment of the latter is separated from the lower
segment, both being of about the same size, by a very oblique
articulation. On the front surfaces of the pedicels
there are two or three pairs of spines.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen.</i>—The three cirri on one side are separated
from their opposite pairs by a prominent, longitudinal fold,
formed of thickened yellowish membrane, which, when
foreshortened by being viewed dorsally, looks like a style
projecting immediately beneath the anus. The transverse
folds separating the three pairs, are exceedingly slight. The
inner basal edges of the pedicels of the cirri project slightly
inwards as apodemes, giving, I believe, attachment to some
muscles. The anus lies between the posterior pair of cirri,
and deeply indents the last thoracic segment. The transverse
folds separating the three pairs of cirri, little developed
as they are, must, according to all analogy, be considered as
representing three segments of the body, and as we have
accounted for seven cephalic and seven thoracic segments,
we must conclude that these are three abdominal segments.
We know, moreover, that the abdomen in the pupæ of the
<a href="#Order_THORACICA">Thoracica</a>, with a single exception, does actually consist of
three segments.</p>

<p><i>Movements of the Mouth, Thorax, and Cirri, &amp;c.</i>—Judging
from the fact of the lancet-shaped appendage of the labrum
being more or less exserted in dead specimens out of the
shell-cavity, and from the analogy of other cirripedes, I do
not doubt that the whole mouth can be considerably raised
and depressed; we have seen, also, that the rostral end of
the toothed orifice of the sack can be pulled down, which
would aid in exposing the mouth and labrum. The well-articulated
thorax, by the aid of the muscles attached to
every segment, can certainly be doubled up and contracted,<a name="Page_577" id="Page_577" href="#Page_577"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 577]</span></a>
so that the cirri with their pedicels (coloured purple like the
exposed labrum) can be wholly protruded out of the sack
and shell-cavity. The three cirri no doubt can be separated
a little from each other, both transversely and longitudinally;
and according to analogy, the two rami of each cirrus can
likewise be separated: there are, also, muscles for moving
the two segments of the pedicel of each cirrus; and other
muscles run up the many segments of the rami. We have
seen that the great lancet-formed appendage of the labrum,
laterally fringed with fine hairs, can be erected; and I do
not doubt that the prey when entangled by the expanded
cirri, is borne against this appendage, and is then, by the
retraction of the thorax, dragged down its smooth surface
to the mouth, where it is seized by the mandibles and
maxillæ, which lie like a trap at the bottom of an inclined
and moveable plane.</p>

<p><i>Alimentary Canal.</i>—The œsophagus is long; it runs
backwards from the mouth and then downwards; at its
lower end, where it enters the stomach, the part, which in
other cirripedes is expanded and bell-shaped, is modified
in a most singular and quite peculiar manner; for the
lower part of the œsophagus, after widening a little,
becomes converted into what appears at first like a square
box, 8/1000ths of an inch across. This box is really deeply folded
(see diagram, Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f11">11</a>) into six longitudinal ridges and
hollows: two of these hollows, facing each other, are wider
than the others, and when the organ is dissected out of the
body, it generally lies (fig. <a href="#p24f10">10</a>) with one of these faces exactly
over the other, the narrower lateral folds being thus hidden,
and the whole consequently appearing like a simple square
box with concave sides. But when a section is made, or the
lower open end is turned upwards, we see that the organ is
six-rayed and elongated, with the longer axis standing
parallel to the flattened sides of the animal's body. The
edges of the folds are formed of yellowish, thickened membrane,
with a sinuous or beaded outline, which serve to
strengthen the organ. Internally, the two broad concave
sides are armed, in their upper inwardly prominent (fig. <a href="#p24f12">12</a>)
part, each with a disc, 2/1000ths of an inch in diameter, crowded
with short, thick, brownish, inwardly projecting teeth. The<a name="Page_578" id="Page_578" href="#Page_578"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 578]</span></a>
two discs stand exactly opposed to each other. The bases
of the teeth, seen from the outside (Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f10">10</a>), seem like
brown little circles, with a smaller circle within. The disc
obscurely appears to be formed by the confluence of two
smaller discs which lie, I believe, at a very small angle to
each other: beneath each of these half discs there is a longitudinal
band of very fine hairs, the two bands uniting into
one, lower down within the organ. The internal longitudinal
edges, also, of the four lateral smaller folds are likewise
clothed with fine hairs; hence we have six parallel longitudinal
rows of very fine but stiff hairs, or eight, if the united
bands on the two broader faces under the discs be counted
each as two. These bands of hairs, and the opposed discs,
armed with very strong teeth, can be separated and brought
together with force, by the action of strong constrictor and
diverging muscles. Hence any prey carried down the
œsophagus, before entering the stomach, would have to pass,
as it were through a mill, and be subjected to a severe
trituration by the discs of teeth, and immediately beneath to
a brushing by the six longitudinal bands of hairs. This
curious and unique structure answers, I believe, the same
purpose as the four convex, hardish, crenated buttons on
the posterior thoracic cirri in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, which are likewise
unique in that genus. I observed that in some specimens
the teeth had been worn quite blunt, but the teeth and hairs
are periodically moulted and renewed, together with the
whole œsophagus.</p>

<p>The stomach is broadest at the upper end, and extends
from a little beneath the mouth down to the fifth segment
of the body, where it becomes narrow. It presented an
irregularly contracted appearance, and was covered by a
pulpy hepatic layer. The rectum is of rather large diameter;
it extends from the middle of the fifth segment to
the end of the eighth segment of the body, or seventh of the
thorax, where the large anus is situated, lying between the
posterior abdominal cirri, and partly hollowed out in this
seventh segment. The rectum, as in all other cirripedes, is
periodically moulted. The food is of a bright green colour,
as if of a confervoid nature; the triturating and brushing
action of the œsophagus seems to roll this matter into pellets,<a name="Page_579" id="Page_579" href="#Page_579"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 579]</span></a>
which apparently retain this form until finally expelled as
excrement: certainly the excrement is in pellets, and I have
several times seen pellets within the stomach.</p>

<p><i>Organs of Generation.</i>—The specimens as yet described
are exclusively female, there being certainly no testes or
vesiculæ seminales. As in every specimen collected (early
in January) there were within the sack either nearly mature
eggs, or young larvæ, it was the worst period for seeing
the ovarian cæca, and I have failed to discover them in
the specimens now long kept in spirits of wine; but I cannot
doubt they would be found, between the inner and outer
tunics of the carapace or general covering, near the disc. I
have stated in my original notes, made when the specimens
were alive, that the ova are at first perfectly detached; but
some appearances make me believe that I overlooked (as
might easily happen) the often <em>excessively</em> fine membrane
which in other cirripedes unites the ova together, and so forms
the ovigerous lamellæ. The ova are much less numerous
than in other genera, varying from only nineteen to about
sixty. In the same individual all the eggs were always in
the same state of development.</p>

<p><i>Metamorphoses.</i>—The true ova, in their earliest condition,
when in the sack, are ovate (Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f15">15</a>), orange-coloured,
quite smooth, and barely 10/1000th of an inch in their longer axes.
They soon become broader at one end than at the other; and
by degrees the narrow posterior pointed end becomes developed
into a slightly club-shaped, almost transparent
(fig. <a href="#p24f16">16</a>) horn, and the broader anterior end, into two rather
longer horns. The length of the oval part, not measuring
the horns, is nearly the same as in the primary true egg
condition. There is as yet no trace of internal organs, the
whole contents consisting of pulpy granular matter. How
far the above changes are effected by moulting, either of
the whole or of part of the integuments of the egg-like
body, I cannot say; but the pulpy matter within the ovum,
even in its earliest stage, was included within an inner envelope
or case.</p>

<p>In the next distinct stage (there being, however, slighter
intermediate changes) the posterior horn has shrunk, and
become converted into a bluntly-pointed conical termina<a name="Page_580" id="Page_580" href="#Page_580"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 580]</span></a>tion
for the whole body (fig. <a href="#p24f17">17</a>), whereas the two anterior
horns have approached each other on the future ventral surface,
and have increased considerably in length and thickness,
and contain within them the prehensile antennæ, which can
be externally seen, and which I dissected out of these horn-like
cases. The oval part of the egg-like larva (for I hardly
know what to call it) is now very slightly shrunk, being hardly
more than 9/1000ths of an inch in length. At this stage, these
bodies adhere by the tips of their anterior horns, containing
the antennæ in process of formation, to the inner tunic of
the sack, and likewise in little groups one to another: as the
included prehensile antennæ ultimately become attached by
cement (proceeding, no doubt, as usual, from a modified
portion of the ovarian tubes), it seems probable that some
cement may at this early period be excreted, but I could
not make out the exact means of attachment. The egg-like
larvæ are, also, aggregated round the tapering curled
dorsal appendages of the second and third segments of the
body, and it is possible that at this, or at an earlier period,
these appendages may act like the ovigerous fræna in the
Lepadidæ, and serve to retain the egg-like larvæ within the
sack.</p>

<p>We come now to the last larval, or pupal condition,
before the final metamorphosis into the mature animal; the
changes above described have been, at least to a great
degree, if not absolutely gradual; but the pupa suddenly
appears perfectly developed, from the moulting of the last-described
horned, egg-like larva. It is now a free animal
crawling about the sack of its female parent. It has increased
a little in length, as compared with the oval part of the egg-like
larva in its second stage, namely, from a little above
9/1000ths to 16/1000ths of an inch: from the position of the prehensile
antennæ in the two states, I have no doubt that this increase
of size is entirely due to the anterior part of the pupa being
doubled up whilst within the egg-like larval envelope. The
pupa in shape (fig. <a href="#p24f18">18</a>) somewhat resembles a coffin, and is
far less laterally compressed than other pupæ, and hence can
easily be placed either on its dorsal or ventral surface. The
prehensile antennæ are of large size: when the animal was
alive, they were concealed under and partially included within,<a name="Page_581" id="Page_581" href="#Page_581"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 581]</span></a>
the front part of the carapace or shell, which in this condition
was not so much truncated as in the drawing given (fig. <a href="#p24f18">18</a>)
of a specimen lying on its back, with its antennæ protruded.
Some specimens formerly examined for me by Dr. Hooker,
had their antennæ and whole ventral surface forced outwards,
apparently from the endosmose of the spirits of wine.
The whole dorsal surface, and the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: over-lapping">overlapping</span> sides of the
carapace are elegantly punctured, and are formed of a rather
brittle substance, here and there supporting, especially at the
front end, some fine and rather long bristles,—which latter I
have not seen on the pupæ of other cirripedes. The ventral
surface is very narrow towards the posterior end of the
animal; it is formed of thin, structureless membrane. On
this surface, close to the posterior end, there is a minute orifice,
through which three pairs of bristles are protruded, attached
to (as I believe) the rudimentary abdomen; the bristles apparently
cannot be withdrawn.</p>

<p>The antennæ, (fig. <a href="#p24f18">18</a>) as stated, are of large size compared
to the whole animal: they resemble, in all essential
respects, the same organ in other cirripedes. The ultimate
segment is unusually thick;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[152]</span></a> it is terminated by five bristles,
one of which is longer than the others, and stands rather
separated from them. The disc-segment is large, nearly
circular, with the broad edges transparent and membranous;
on its posterior edge there is a single small spine. The
second or main segment, counting from the base, has a
single spine on its upper margin, close beneath the spine
on the disc; it is articulated to the disc-segment, a little
way from the disc itself,—which is a peculiarity I have not
elsewhere noticed. The basal segment is thick and not so
short as usual. These organs are furnished with powerful
muscles. They are generally protruded alternately; and
by the adhesion of the sucker-like disc, the animal drags
itself along. The sucker-disc has great play, and when
observing specimens alive, I compared its action to that of<a name="Page_582" id="Page_582" href="#Page_582"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 582]</span></a>
a wrist-joint. The antennæ, when retracted within the
carapace, lie parallel to each other.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_152_152" id="Footnote_152_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152_152"><span class="label">[152]</span></a> As I have given, in my former volume on the Lepadidæ, p. 286, so many
measurements of the antennæ, I may here add those of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Crystophialus">Cryptophialus</span></a>,—the
length from the end of the disc to the end of the second segment, (formerly
called by me, erroneously, the basal,) is 26/6000ths of an inch; the greatest width
of the second segment, 9/6000ths; the length of the little ultimate segment,
3/6000ths, and its width under 3/20000ths of an inch.</p></div>

<p>Posteriorly to the antenna, I distinctly saw the apodemes
to which the eyes are attached: I was not able to distinguish
any middle fork to the apodeme, which consequently
does not resemble a UU, but U. The eyes are dark purple,
and, as usual, compound: in one specimen I counted
twelve ocelli within the common spherical envelope.</p>

<p>I could not distinguish any thorax, and certainly there is
no mouth; nor, from analogy, could the latter be expected,
excepting as forming part of the young cirripede: there are
no natatory legs, which the pupæ in all other cirripedes
possess. Of the three postero-ventral pairs of bristles, the
most posterior or dorsal pair, differs from the other two
pairs in being considerably smaller, and in being mounted
on elongated pedicels: the two anterior pairs of bristles are
strong: the three pairs are articulated, one behind the other,
on a small body, apparently enclosed in a minute sack, and
certainly attached all round by membrane to the internal
edges of the orifice, through which the bristles are protruded.
These bristles, when the pupa was alive, were often moved, and
served apparently to steady the body during the alternate
protraction and retraction of the prehensile antennæ. From
the fact of the pupa of other cirripedes having an abdomen,
formed of three segments, placed exactly in the same position
as the minute body here supporting the three pairs
of spines, I believe this body to be the abdomen. In other
cirripedes only the posterior segment of the abdomen bears
spines, which are supported on little limbs or pedicels,
namely, the caudal appendages, the other segments being
naked. But as the mature <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, unlike other
cirripedes, has abdominal cirri, the presence of spines on the
corresponding abdominal segments in the pupa, is explained
and rendered probable: there can, I think, be little doubt
that the small terminal pair of spines, supported on elongated
pedicels or limbs, answers to the caudal appendages
found in many cirripedes.</p>

<p>The whole course of the metamorphosis is very peculiar.
The gradual changes in the egg-like larvæ (for I suppose
they must be called larvæ) from a simple oval egg, to pointed<a name="Page_583" id="Page_583" href="#Page_583"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 583]</span></a>
oval, to oval with three horns, and lastly to oval with the
two anterior horns larger, and the posterior horn reduced
to a mere point, seems to me very curious; and offers, as
far as I know, a unique case. It is interesting to reflect
how perfect a series, in the development of an animal, we
have, in different members of the Articulata,—from an ordinary
egg, in which all the changes go on unperceived, and
whence a perfect animal is matured,—to an egg-like larva
which undergoes the changes just described, and which
turns into a pupa that does not eat or increase in size,—to
a larva which eats and increases in size, but undergoes only
one great change, as in most insects,—to a larva undergoing
several great changes, as in the case of ordinary cirripedes,
before its final metamorphosis into the mature animal.
The first larval condition of other cirripedes, in which there
is a single eye, three pairs of thoracic limbs, and a much
elongated pointed body, covered by a prolongation of the
carapace, is here not fully developed or matured; but this
stage is, I think, clearly and very curiously indicated by the
posterior horn of the egg-like larva, which we may suppose
represents the posterior pointed end of the body, for it disappears
in the succeeding stage, just as it does in the second
larval condition of other cirripedes. In the first stage of ordinary
cirripedial larvæ, the anterior horns are always present,
serving, as in the case of these egg-like bodies, to <span class="correction" title="In the original book: inclose">enclose</span> and
protect the antennæ during their formation. The second
egg-like stage answers to the second larval condition of
ordinary cirripedes, as described (and figured, Pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f01">1</a>)
in the introduction to the <a href="#Family_Balanidae">Balanidæ</a>. The third or pupal
state is fully developed in all cases.</p>

<p>Finally, the pupa of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> is peculiar in its
punctured, hairy surface, and in its shape, which, in being
so much more depressed than usual, retains an earlier larval
condition; but its chief and highly remarkable character
consists in the entire absence of natatory legs; and, in consequence,
instead of there being a large sack within the carapace,
with an elongated orifice on the ventral surface, there is
only a quite minute orifice at the extreme posterior end of the
animal, through which the bristles, borne apparently on all
three segments of the minute abdomen, are protruded.</p>

<p><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584" href="#Page_584"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 584]</span></a></p>

<p>The pupæ of the male and female are exactly alike in all
their general characters, and probably in every point of detail;
but my later and more minute observations were
made only on pupæ, which, from their place of attachment,
would certainly have turned into males. As these pupæ,
without any further metamorphosis, were developed into
males, we may, I think, safely infer that such is the case
with the females: and, consequently, that the whole course
of the metamorphosis has been, in this cirripede, seen
and described. During this whole course, no food could
possibly have been obtained, for the pupa is destitute of a
mouth or organs of prehension, and the stock of cellular
matter, enclosed within the ovum, has been sufficient for all
the above changes, and for the final metamorphosis. We
shall, moreover, immediately see, in the case of the male,
that the stock of cellular matter has also sufficed for the
development of testes, spermatozoa, and a wonderfully elongated
probosciformed penis.</p>

<p>By throwing pieces of the perforated shell of a Concholepas
into acid, I examined several scores of specimens of
the <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, and on all, with the exception of a few
young individuals, males were attached. They were attached
by cement, proceeding in the usual manner from the prehensile
antennæ, outside, to the edges of the upper half of
the disc formed of the thicker not-moulted membrane, by
which the female adheres in her chamber: hence the males
are included in the upper part of the same cavity with the
female, into which they must have crawled as pupæ. I
found from one or two up, in one case, to seven males,
attached to the same female; four or five being the most
usual number. In the early part of January, when all my
specimens were taken, many of the males had not shed
their pupal integuments, and of those that had, the majority
were immature, a few only having spermatozoa: all the
females had within their sacks, either ova including almost<a name="Page_585" id="Page_585" href="#Page_585"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 585]</span></a>
perfect pupæ, or fully developed pupæ: we may, consequently,
conclude that these young males were maturing
in order to impregnate the next set of eggs.</p>

<p>The male, immediately after its metamorphosis from its
pupal condition, which has been fully described, is almost
globular, but slightly bilobed, and is formed of strong,
structureless, transparent membrane, including a mass of
cellular matter, apparently without any included organs:
it is attached by about the middle, between the anterior and
posterior lobes, by the not-moulted prehensile antennæ.
When the male is mature, its greatest length, measured
from the posterior end, where the orifice is seated, to the
anterior and blunter end, is about 13/1000 of an inch, and
therefore rather less than the pupa, which was 16/1000ths in
length. Relatively to a full grown female, the male slightly
exceeds half the diameter of the toothed orifice leading into
her sack, see (<i>z</i>) fig. <a href="#p23f01">1</a>, Pl. <a href="#Page_707">23</a>. In the mature condition,
(fig. <a href="#p24f19">19</a>), one lobe, namely, the upper or posterior, has
become more pointed, and is terminated by a minute
orifice, 8/6000ths of an inch in diameter. This orifice is formed
by a rim of thickened brownish membrane, which, on what
was the ventral surface, has a few very minute, but strong,
sometimes bifid spines;—in this one character, the male resembling
the female. The other and lower (homologically
anterior) end or lobe is broader, and contains a mass of
cellular matter, which, from its close resemblance in appearance
and position to similar matter within the male
<a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, I have no doubt forms the contents of the testis.
In one single specimen, I succeeded in isolating a vesicula
seminalis of small size, containing perfectly distinct spermatozoa.
Across the middle, between the two lobes, close
under the outer integument, there is a broad layer of rather
strong transverse muscular fasciæ. I did not observe any
eye, the presence of which I should have expected from
analogy. Internally there is no mouth, thorax, cirri, or other
organs, excepting the testis and vesicula seminalis just mentioned,
and an immensely elongated probosciformed penis,
coiled up and filling the rest of the inside of the sack down to
the testis, which latter occupies the whole anterior, and generally
lower end of the animal. This penis is plainly articulated,
and includes fine transversely-striated muscles: no<a name="Page_586" id="Page_586" href="#Page_586"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 586]</span></a>
doubt it can be protruded through the minute orifice, and
voluntarily moved about. Out of a male, 12/1000ths of an
inch in length, I dissected a penis, which, when not
stretched, measured 50/1000ths of an inch in length; when a
portion was pulled between two needles, it could be
stretched to apparently three times its former length, and
I should think that this organ could be extended by the
animal to, perhaps, even the 100/1000ths of an inch,—that is, to
between eight and nine times its own entire length! The
use of this enormously elongated penis obviously is, that
the spermatozoa of these males, which are so extremely
small in size, compared to the female, should all be conveyed
within the sack, and none be lost. It should be
borne in mind, that the whole male, including every part,
is scarcely larger than a single ovum, of which sometimes
sixty have to be impregnated by only two or three males.
In a full-grown female, the distance from one of the attached
males to the middle of the orifice leading into the sack, is
about the 5/100ths of an inch, equal to the length of the coiled
up, not-extended penis: the further distance from the orifice
of the sack to an ovum lying at the bottom of the sack,
would be almost 10/100ths of an inch, so that the spermatozoa
have to pass a distance of 15/100ths of an inch from the testis of
the male to the lower ova. I believe two thirds of this distance
would be passed safely along the probosciformed penis.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the male of <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>
and of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> is truly surprising; and is the more wonderful,
considering the great dissimilarity of their pupæ.
Hardly any characters can be pointed out in which these
males differ, excepting such as might have been thought
of only specific value, namely the relative proportions of
the different parts, and mere external shape. The peduncle
growing a little after the metamorphosis, in the
male of <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and the prolongation of its capitulum with
the included oblique ligamentous fibres, are the greatest
differences. Having fully remarked, under <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, on the
wonderfully rudimentary condition of these males, destitute
as they are of so many parts and organs, I will here say
nothing further on these singular creatures, destined to discharge
their spermatozoa, die, and be succeeded by a fresh
set of short-lived male successors.</p>

<p><i>Cirripedia, with the carapace reduced to two separate
threads, serving for attachment: body consisting of one cephalic,
seven thoracic, and three abdominal segments, all
destitute of cirri. Mouth suctorial, with the mandibles and
maxillæ placed back to back, enclosed in a hood, formed by
the union of the labrum and palpi. Metamorphoses unknown.</i></p>


<p class="p2">The characters above given fully justify, I think, the
formation of this order; though it contains only one species,
the <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta"><i>Proteolepas bivincta</i></a>. The mere external appearance
(Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f07">7</a>), so wonderfully different from that of every
other cirripede, would by itself prompt to this same conclusion.
At first sight the <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, if of fresh-water
origin, might even have been mistaken for the larva of
some insect, fastened by two threads to its prey. The
entire absence of the three anterior segments of the head
and therefore of the carapace, or, speaking strictly, the mere
rudiment of these parts, forming an envelope to the two cement-ducts,—the
absence of a stomach, rectum, and anus,—the
entire absence of thoracic and abdominal appendages
or cirri,—the absence of a probosciformed penis,—are all
negative characters, which might ensue from degradation,
so common with parasites; and which might, therefore, have
been esteemed of not high classificatory value. But the suctorial
mouth, with the palpi and labrum united into a hood,
and with the mandibles and maxillæ reversed or turned back
to back, so as to be utterly incapable of prehension, is a type
of structure not hitherto met with, I believe, in any other
animal, and cannot be explained away by degradation.
The formation of the ova within the segments of the body,
a peculiarity confined to this one cirripede, evidently
results from the non-development of the anterior part of
the head, within which the ova are usually formed; but the
compound structure of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: visicula">vesicula</span> seminalis is a peculiarity<a name="Page_588" id="Page_588" href="#Page_588"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 588]</span></a>
which cannot be thus explained. <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> has no particular
affinity to any other cirripede; it resembles, indeed,
<a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a> in one important point, but only in one point,
namely, in the number of the segments of its body. It is
really beautiful to see how the homologies of the archetype
cirripede, as deduced from the metamorphoses of other cirripedes,
are plainly illustrated during the maturity of this
degraded creature, and are demonstrated to be identical with
those of the archetype Crustacean. I was at first inclined
to rank <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> in one division, and all other cirripedes
in another division of equal value; but as it may be inferred
from the characters of the prehensile antennæ, that the pupa
did not differ much, if at all in any important character, from
the pupæ of other cirripedes, I have thought the three orders,
which I have instituted, would be the most natural arrangement.
As any one looking at the drawing given of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>,
might very naturally feel inclined to protest against
its being ranked as a cirripede, I must reurge the importance
of the pupal antennæ being constituted on the common
type, for from their structure, by the law of correlation, that
of the whole pupa may be inferred; and even still more I
must insist on the importance of the one great character of
the antennæ being cemented to the surface of attachment by
matter proceeding, as we shall see, in a modified state, from
the great ovarian sack. The structure, also, of the mouth
(to a certain extent), the segmentation of the body, though
in appearance so peculiar, the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: hermaphodite">hermaphrodite</span> condition, the
single penis, the absence of oviducts, all accord with, and
taken together demonstrate, its cirripedial nature.</p>

remarked, curiously resembles, at the first glance, the larva
of some insect. It is rounded, but somewhat compressed,
and tapers gently towards the posterior end. It lies curved
in an arc, the ventral surface being concave, and the dorsal
convex, but a little flattened dorsally at the anterior and
blunter end. Its length, if straightened, would rather
exceed one fifth of an inch. The body consists of eleven
segments, which, excepting the three terminal, are conspicuously
plain. The first segment is surmounted by a
rather small mouth, which any one would, assuredly, at first
consider as the entire head, though he would in vain search
here for eyes, antennæ, or other parts of the three anterior
cephalic segments. On the dorsal surface, low down on
the second segment of the body, two, quite flexible, thin,
but strong, flattened threads arise, which terminate in a pair
of prehensile antennæ, having the usual cirripedial structure.
From the penultimate or disc segment of these
antennæ, cement has been excreted, by which the antennæ
are firmly cemented low down to the rostral end of the
sack of the cirripede, the <span class="correction" title="This name is suspect, but the correct name is not obvious."><i>Alepas cornuta</i></span>, on which it

body of the Alepas: its mouth lies under the middle of
the soft prosoma of the latter cirripede, which I cannot
doubt that it lacerates and sucks.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_153_153" id="Footnote_153_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153_153"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> I may be permitted to premise, that though I procured only a single
specimen, yet perceiving its very singular nature, I took such care and length
of time in the dissection, and repeated every observation so many times that
I think reliance may be placed on the description here given. Fortunately I
had acquired, from dissecting many much smaller specimens of various cirripedes,
all the advantage which full experience could give me, when I commenced
on <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>.</p></div>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>—The mouth is suctorial, and is constructed on a
different plan from that in any other cirripede, or, indeed, in any<a name="Page_590" id="Page_590" href="#Page_590"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 590]</span></a>
other, as far as I know, articulated animal. It is narrower,
in both a longitudinal and transverse plane, than the first
segment of the body, and is distinctly separated from it.
The lower part on the ventral side, is protuberant and
rounded. The summit is square, and is formed by the crest
of the labrum, with two large palpi (<i>d</i>, fig. <a href="#p24f03">3</a>), having nearly
the usual form amongst the <a href="#Sub-Family_Balaninae">Balaninæ</a>, and pointing towards
each other, but differently from in any other Cirripede, they
are united for their whole length to the labrum, and by
their extremities to each other. These parts together thus
form an arch or hood, within which stand the other
gnathites. The palpi are roughened by groups of very minute
spines. At their bases they can be obscurely seen to
be separated from the rest of the mouth by an oblique
joining or articulation. The back of the mouth is formed
entirely of the labrum, which becomes narrow towards its
base: it is, from top to bottom, 20/1000ths of an inch in height.
Within the hood formed by the palpi and labrum, a pair (<i>c</i>,
fig. <a href="#p24f03">3</a>), of very singular, compounded, mandibular organs project
freely, straight up, with their convex outer edges placed
parallel and close together, and their teeth pointing directly
from each other, so that they stand in a reversed position
compared with the jaws of all other cirripedes, and are
absolutely incapable of prehension.</p>

<p>This compounded organ is singularly small compared
with the palpi and labrum: it is narrow, being about 5/3000ths
of an inch in width, but is produced upwards, so that a
considerable length projects freely, and the rounded, properly
external, margin can be traced down for a length of
about 20/3000ths of an inch. In a lateral view of the mouth,
the extreme tip of the mandibular organ could sometimes be
seen just projecting out of the hood. The mandibular organ,
when separated and carefully examined, presents the appearance,
represented from a camera drawing, in (Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>,
fig. <a href="#p24f02">2</a>): we here see three groups of teeth; of these the lower
set (<i>c</i>) consists of blunter teeth, placed more transversely,
and easily separated from the others, and altogether clearly
appears like a distinct organ. I do not feel nearly so sure
regarding the other two sets; my first impression was strongly
that they were distinct organs, closely united laterally to<a name="Page_591" id="Page_591" href="#Page_591"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 591]</span></a>gether,—one
(<i>a</i>) probably representing the mandibles, and
formed into a single large tooth; the other (<i>b</i>) formed of
three teeth, and probably representing the outer maxillæ;
the first-mentioned set of teeth, which seemed to me to arise
from between the other two sets, being the inner maxillæ.
If this view (and it must be remembered how excessively
minute the parts are) be not, as I now suspect, correct, we
must suppose that the outer maxillæ are aborted, and we
have seen some tendency towards this in other cirripedes;
the compounded organ being formed only of the mandibles
(having on this view four teeth) and the inner maxillæ. As
far as the mandibles are concerned, their existence, I may
remark, is plainly shown by the presence of the palpi,
which in all cases belong to and form part of the mandibles.
The ventral surface of the mouth, immediately beneath the
free portion of the compounded mandibular organ, consists
of a triangular projection, but I could see no appearances to
make me suppose that this part represented the outer maxillæ.
The compound organ—in general shape, and in the oblique
manner in which the front part is cut off and terminates in
ligamentous apodemes, to which muscles are attached,—presents
an unmistakable likeness to a mandible. It is hollow
within, and muscles appear to extend some way up, perhaps
to the transversely toothed portion, which represents, as I
believe, the inner maxillæ: these two groups of teeth, anyhow,
seemed to have some power of sliding over each other,
and altered their positions during the course of dissection.
On each side of the mouth, there is a muscle attached by its
lower end to the basal edge of the labrum, and two others,
one above the other, attached by their lower ends to about
the middle of the labrum; these muscles, which are distinctly
striated or voluntary, I infer, from analogy, run up
to the ligamentous apodemes of the compound mandibles.
There appeared to be other more delicate muscles attached
to the basal articulation of the mouth on the ventral face,
and these, I presume, would run to the supposed inner
maxillæ.</p>

<p>The mouth in forming a prominence separated by a distinct
articulation from the body, and in the union of the
palpi and labrum (though here carried to excess), is con<a name="Page_592" id="Page_592" href="#Page_592"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 592]</span></a>structed
so far on the cirripedial type; but how are we to
account for the extraordinary reversed position of the united
mandibles and maxillæ, with their backs almost touching
each other, and their toothed edges twisted round so as to
face outwards in a manner unexampled, I believe, in any
other articulate animal? It might, perhaps, be at first suspected,
that the compounded mandible had not really been
twisted round, but that the teeth had been abnormally developed
on the outer convex margin: this view, however,
certainly cannot be admitted, for the properly outer convex
margin can be traced running far down the mouth, in a
manner utterly inexplicable, if this were really the inner
side; and equally inexplicable on this view would be the
position of the ligamentous apodemes. Hence I cannot
doubt that this compounded mandibular organ has really rotated
on its axis; and if the course of development could
be followed, I suspect that the twisting would be seen to be
effected as follows: we know in all cirripedes that the outer
and inner maxillæ, and to a certain extent the mandibles,
instead of facing each other, are directed towards the labrum;
they therefore have already been twisted round a quarter of
a circle, as may be seen in the diagram (Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f04">4</a>),
copied from the mouth of Ibla. Now let us drive inwards
the front of the mouth, along a narrow medial line; these
organs would then (fig. <a href="#p24f05">5</a>) be compelled to turn round a
quarter of a circle more, and so face directly outwards. In
this process, the integument between the lower and outer
part of the mandible and the base of the palpus, which
normally are in close contact, would have to be greatly
stretched. By a movement of this order, the mandibles
would come to stand posteriorly or exteriorly to the other
gnathites; and as far as I could make out (previously to my
having any theory) the large single toothed portion of the
compound organ which most resembles a mandible, did
really stand outside the other toothed portion.</p>

<p>With respect to the action of this singularly constructed
mouth; if its ventral and oblique surface were applied to
any yielding object, as the adjoining soft prosoma of the
Alepas, the compound mandibles would be worked within an
absolutely closed chamber. The action of these mandibles<a name="Page_593" id="Page_593" href="#Page_593"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 593]</span></a>
would be to make a transverse slit, and subsequently to serve
as a grapnel to keep the mouth closely adpressed to its prey:
the other teeth might act in keeping the wound open.
When the mouth was thus closely adpressed over a wound,
the great power of shortening the whole body which the animal
possesses (the œsophagus being closed), would, by the
subsequent action of the elasticity of the outer membrane,
almost certainly create suction, and thus cause the nutritious
juices of the Alepas to flow into the body of the
parasite. Hence I have called the mouth suctorial.</p>

<p><i>Body.</i>—This, as already stated, consists of eleven segments,
of which the three posterior (abdominal) smaller
segments can hardly be distinguished, without dissection, as
separate from each other. The body is mainly occupied by
a vast ovarian sack (<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, fig. <a href="#p25f07">7</a>), filled by innumerable ova:
and the three posterior segments by small testes and their
vesiculæ seminales (<i>i</i>): but I shall return to the internal
anatomy. The outer membrane, lined by delicate corium,
is thin, transparent, elastic, and covered by groups of
excessively minute blunt little points. The segments can
be plainly distinguished by their outlines, especially on the
ventral surface; but they are rendered unmistakably distinct
by the attachment of the muscles; they can also be
perceived when the external membrane is perfectly cleaned,
by yellowish lines. The muscular system is highly symmetrical
and simple: along all eleven segments, there is a
narrow, medial, ventral and dorsal clear space; on both
sides of which space there is a band of longitudinal muscles,
which, though encroaching on the two sides, and rather
largely on the dorso-lateral sides, may be called the ventral
and dorsal muscles. These muscles are striæ-less, which is
the case with the homologous posterior thoracic muscles in
some other cirripedes: on the dorsal surface (lower surface in
fig. <a href="#p25f07">7</a>) they are more spread out, and consist, on each side of
the medial line, of four ribbons: this seems to be the case on
the ventral side, but the ribbons are here much more confluent:
in the seventh and eighth segments, the ribbons become
broader; but in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh, or three
posterior segments, they become much narrower, and some
of the fasciæ disappear, so that these muscles can hardly<a name="Page_594" id="Page_594" href="#Page_594"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 594]</span></a>
be seen from the outside. Each separate ribbon expands
a little at its two ends, which are attached to the articulations
separating the successive segments: I carefully observed
that they did not pass over at either end to the
adjoining segments: hence their action must be either simply
to shorten and arch each segment separately; or when acting
together, to shorten the whole body, or perhaps the ventral
or dorsal surface by itself.</p>

<p>In the first segment, and in the three posterior segments,
these longitudinal muscles alone occur; but on the seven
segments, from the second to the eighth inclusive, there are
other oblique latero-ventral muscles. These muscles lie
within the longitudinal muscles, and adhere pretty firmly to
the coat (<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, fig. <a href="#p25f07">7</a>) of the great ovarian sack. At their ventral
extremities they are attached, near the anterior margin of
each segment, beneath the point of attachment of the longitudinal
fasciæ, and thence they run posteriorly in an oblique
line to the anterior margin of the next succeeding segment,
where they are attached: so that these muscles run obliquely
from segment to segment. The first of these oblique muscles,
lying chiefly within the second segment of the body, is thinner
and longer than the others: those within the third and fourth
segments are short: those within the fifth and succeeding
segments extend, at their dorsal (or lower in fig. <a href="#p25f07">7</a>) extremities,
as far as the outer dorsal longitudinal fasciæ: those
within the seventh segment are broad and short, and cross
the longitudinal muscles at only a small angle. In the
eighth segment, there is an oblique lateral muscle, like
that in the seventh segment, running from the ventral surface
towards the dorsal surface; but there is in addition a
second oblique lateral muscle, rising from the dorsal surface,
and running towards the ventral surface. This muscle does
not occur in the other segments, but in the fourth segment,
at the dorsal end of the oblique latero-ventral muscle, there
may be seen a small branch of fibres, at right angles, which
seems to represent a muscle homologous with that just mentioned
in the eighth segment: obscure traces, moreover, of
similar fibres, can be detected in some of the other segments:
had these oblique latero-dorsal muscles been as fully
developed in the seven anterior segments of the body, as on<a name="Page_595" id="Page_595" href="#Page_595"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 595]</span></a>
the eighth segment, the whole muscular system would have
been perfectly symmetrical. The oblique latero-ventral
muscle in the sixth segment is distinctly striated transversely;
but this is not the case with most of the other muscles,
if with any of them; I cannot account for this difference.
The muscles of the gnathites are the only other voluntary
muscles in the animal's body.</p>

<p><i>Homologies of the Body.</i>—It will hereafter be, I think,
clearly shown, that when the shell and integuments of the
pupa of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> are shed, no carapace or general covering
for the body is formed; the three anterior segments of the
head, the backward prolongation of which (as has been elsewhere
explained) certainly forms the carapace of ordinary
cirripedes, being here almost absolutely aborted. In every
cirripede the mouth is formed of three pairs of gnathites,
which, no one will doubt, rise from the fourth, fifth, and
sixth segments of the head: here in <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, the mouth,
even on the view of the mandibular organ on each side being
compounded of only two gnathites, sufficiently resembles the
ordinary cirripedial type to make it very probable, that if
examined in the earliest stage of its development, three pairs
of gnathites would be discovered. In accordance with this
conclusion, the segment succeeding the mouth (<i>i. e.</i>, the first
segment of the body in fig. <a href="#p25f07">7</a>) homologically is the seventh,
or last cephalic segment. The succeeding seven segments,
of course, are the seven thoracic segments, and the three
posterior segments are abdominal; the latter are not developed
in ordinary cirripedes when mature, but are present
during their pupal condition. Now this conclusion, which
is, in fact, deduced from what we know of the front part of
the head in other cirripedes, both larval and mature, appears
to me most satisfactorily confirmed by the differences in the
muscular system of the segments in <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>. In no
other way, I believe, can it be explained, why the last cephalic
segment and the three abdominal segments should differ
from the seven thoracic segments, in the entire absence of
the oblique lateral muscles. The abdominal segments,
moreover, differ a little in shape, in the indistinctness of their
articulation, in the thinness of the longitudinal muscles, and
even in their contents. With respect to the two threads<a name="Page_596" id="Page_596" href="#Page_596"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 596]</span></a>
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: inclosing">enclosing</span> the cement-ducts, which spring from the second
segment of the body (or first of the thorax), and which terminate
within the prehensile antennæ of the pupa, we shall
hereafter see that their apparently most anomalous position,
and even the flattened shape of the dorsal surface of the
two anterior segments of the body, all accord perfectly with
the homologies just given.</p>

<p><i>Alimentary Canal.</i>—The œsophagus is thin, and for a
cirripede short, for it extends only half-way down the first
segment (<i>i. e.</i> last cephalic) of the body; the lower end,
which is slightly dilated, nearly touches the anterior end of
the great ovarian sack. At its upper end, it is surrounded
by delicate, striæ-less constrictor muscles; and there are
others radiating outwards, evidently serving to open it:
the lower part of the œsophagus, differently from other
cirripedes, is destitute of muscles, and is only coated by a
thin layer of corium, which would serve to produce a new
œsophagus at each exuviation. Strange as the fact may be,
I am prepared to assert that there is no stomach, rectum,
or anus. As I was able to trace so distinctly the œsophagus,
and likewise the generally far smaller orifice and ducts of
the male generative organs, I consider it quite impossible
that I could have missed the stomach. The rectum and
anus are absent in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>: and the absence of a stomach
is here in some degree the less surprising, as the structure
of the mouth shows that <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> must live on the already
elaborated fluids of the Alepas, to which, being a cirripede,
it is allied. It is of some importance to observe, that the
œsophagus is fitted with muscles simply for shutting and
opening it, the wave-like swallowing action of which other
cirripedes are capable, being, apparently, here impossible;
but the contraction of the body and its subsequent expansion,
the œsophagus being opened, would allow the blood
of its prey to flow inwards.</p>

<p>The nervous system must be much atrophied, for I could
not detect it, and the small size of the animal is not sufficient
to account for this: I wish I could have seen this system,
for then I should almost certainly have beheld an articulate
animal without a trace of a supra-œsophageal ganglion.
There is no eye, but such could hardly be expected, as the<a name="Page_597" id="Page_597" href="#Page_597"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 597]</span></a>
anterior cephalic segments are aborted. There are no
branchiæ. I may state that within the abdomen, along
the dorsal surface, there was either a lacuna or a delicate
vessel, apparently of a circulatory nature, of considerable
diameter, which, near the extreme posterior end of the body,
gave out branches.</p>

<p><i>Female Reproductive Organs.</i>—The eight anterior segments
of the body, with the exception of a small space at the
two ends, are occupied by an immense (<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>), opaque, ovarian
sack. The tissue forming it is delicate, and presents a
peculiar cellular aspect: it is slightly attached to the
corium on the ventral surface of the body, and to the oblique
latero-ventral muscles. Internally, at the anterior end, it
is thickly coated by cellular matter, the cells varying from
4/6000ths to less than 1/6000th of an inch in diameter, becoming
in parts confluent, and the whole forming a dark orange-coloured
mass. In the more central parts of the sack this
cellular matter became aggregated into little pellets, which,
in proceeding towards the posterior end of the sack, gradually
increased in size, from about (4 to 6)/1000ths of an inch in
diameter, and at last appeared as almost mature and perfect
ova of a broadly oval figure. Their size, as we see, is
small, and their number almost infinite. I carefully examined
all round this ovarian sack, and could detect no
oviducts; nor from analogy could they be expected: I have
no doubt that the ova burst forth by the rupture, probably,
of the posterior end of the sack and of the overlying
corium; and that they accumulate beneath the external membrane
of the body, until this is moulted, the rupture beneath
being in the meantime healed, when they are freed, or
perhaps temporarily protected in the old moulted envelope
of the body.</p>

<p>On each side, within the first two segments of the body,
and projecting a little before the great ovarian sack (<i>e</i>), two
gut-formed organs (<i>f</i>) may be seen, even from the outside,
owing to their opacity and dark colour. They lie near the
external surface; the first pair of latero-ventral oblique muscles
passing between them and the ovarian sack. They are
formed of a branching, grape-like mass of opaque, orange-coloured
cells. They are intimately united, at their pos<a name="Page_598" id="Page_598" href="#Page_598"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 598]</span></a>terior
extremities, to the ovarian sack, and I believe open
into it; but I cannot say that I demonstrated this. From
their absolute identity in structure, and similarity in position,
namely, on each side of the lower end of the œsophagus,
no doubt is left on my mind that these bodies
answer to the true ovaria, which are situated within the
body of other cirripedes; and that the ovarian sack answers
to the inosculating and branching ovarian tubes and cæca,
which fill the peduncle, or cover the basis in other cirripedes,
but here, from the absence of these parts, necessarily occupying
the body.</p>

<p><i>Male Organs.</i>—The whole surface of the ovarian sack, the
space before it, even to within the lower parts of the mouth,
the posterior half of the last thoracic segment, and especially
the whole three abdominal segments, are completely
netted by branching delicate vessels or ducts terminating
in spherical glands about 1/2000th of an inch in diameter.
These little glands include a brownish pulpy centre, and
sufficiently resemble the testes of other cirripedes in
appearance, position, and connecting ducts, to make me
believe that such is their nature. I may remark that
in the more central parts of the abdomen the glands and
ducts seemed to be in process of formation by the confluence
of cellular matter, and in some other cirripedes
I have suspected that the testes are periodically renewed,
or at least redeveloped from an undistinguishable condition.
Within the posterior half of the abdomen, some of the ducts
become thicker and unite, others joining in laterally, so as
together to make a dark chord, 7/2000ths of an inch in diameter.
Until dissecting this chord, I thought it was a single vesicula
seminalis, but it separated into several rather thick ducts
or vesiculæ. I was not able to remove from within them
the contained matter, but it appeared very finely and longitudinally
flocculent, like spermatozoa not quite matured. In
accordance with the immature state of the contents of the
ovarian sack, in all probability these ducts would hereafter
have become greatly enlarged, and have formed a compound
vesicula seminalis of considerable size. The dark chord,
formed by their union, contracts as it enters the rudimentary
penis, and terminates in a very minute orifice on<a name="Page_599" id="Page_599" href="#Page_599"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 599]</span></a>
its apex. The penis consists of a papilla, only 3/4000ths of an
inch in length, situated on the extreme point of the
abdomen, but rather towards the ventral surface.</p>

<p><i>Metamorphosis.</i>—In accordance with the general law of
the correlation of parts, it may be inferred, from the description
and measurements of the pupal antennæ immediately to
be given, that this abnormal creature was developed within
a pupa of the same general structure, and of about the size,
as the pupæ whence Scalpellum, <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, and many other
cirripedes are developed. As the ova are of remarkably
small size, indeed I have seen no others quite so small, it is
certain that the larvæ, as in the case with all other cirripedes,
excepting <a href="#Cryptophialus_minutus">Cryptophialus</a>, must undergo several metamorphoses,
and increase much in size, before attaining their
pupal condition.</p>

<p><i>Attachment.</i>—The animal is attached, as already stated,
to the sack of the Alepas by two threads, rising close together
from the medio-dorsal line, near the posterior end of
the second segment of the body. These threads are attached
likewise close together at their further ends, by the antennæ,
into which they enter. They are flattened and strong,
yet quite flexible, with a somewhat sinuous surface: they
were, in this specimen, 42/1000ths of an inch in length, and a
little above 3/1000ths in diameter: where joined to the thoracic
segment they were a little contracted. Their structure in
this specimen could be made out (Pl. <a href="#Page_708">24</a>, fig. <a href="#p24f01">1</a>) with perfect
distinctness. Their transparent outer tunic (<i>e</i>, fig. <a href="#p24f01">1</a>) is
1/2000ths of an inch in thickness, and is continuous with that (<i>d</i>)
enveloping the whole body, but is abruptly and considerably
thicker than this membrane; and hence a very slight collar
is formed outside, round the line of junction of each thread
with the body. The delicate corium (<i>c</i>) lining the external
membrane of the body runs, at least someway, down these
threads. It was likewise indisputably evident that the membrane
(<i>b</i>), for I separated it by dissection, forming the great
ovarian sack, together with the cellular contents of this sack
(<i>a</i>), entered and extended down both threads. It should, also,
be particularly observed, that the coarsely cellular matter
within the ovarian sack, immediately that it entered the tube
formed by the membrane of the ovarian sack, suddenly changed<a name="Page_600" id="Page_600" href="#Page_600"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 600]</span></a>
its appearance into a homogeneous, stiff, pulpy matter, which
retained the same appearance all down the threads to within
the antennæ. This finer matter readily separated from the
coarser cellular matter within the sack, but was not divided
from it by any septum or membrane. Some way within
the threads, the corium, the membrane of the ovarian sack,
and the contents appear (<i>e′</i>), as seen from the outside, to
become, and perhaps really are, blended together. These
threads could not have been originally formed of their present
length, and must therefore have been added to during the
growth of the animal; but from their entering the not-moulted
antennæ, and from the animal being permanently
attached by them, they cannot have grown, by means of
the moulting of their integuments; hence I conclude that
at each period of growth and exuviation they have been
added to only at their upper ends, where there is a sort of
collar, or line of growth; and where, I may remark, the
lining corium is alone well developed. We shall presently
see the bearing of these remarks.</p>

<p>These threads contract to about half their former diameter
as they enter the old prehensile antennæ of the pupa, within
which they are firmly attached. Each thread, with its three
tunics apparently blended together, can be traced to the
extremity of the disc-segment (<i>g</i>), where the included matter
seems to have burst forth. The whole disc and the terminal
segment of both antennæ are enveloped, close together, in
cement, formed into two almost separate little capsules, by
which they adhere very firmly to the integuments of the
Alepas. The cement required to be removed before the
antennæ could be plainly seen. The cement presented all
the usual characters, namely, its homogeneous laminated
structure and its yellowish colour. The cement in the
case of the male Ibla, which is parasitic within the sack of
the female Ibla, affects the corium and fibrous matter
beneath the chitine-tunic, and causes them to adhere together,
and thus prevents the male from being cast off
each time that the inner tunic of the sack of the female
is moulted: exactly so has the cement of the <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>
affected the integuments of the Alepas. The only difference
between ordinary cement-ducts and the two threads here<a name="Page_601" id="Page_601" href="#Page_601"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 601]</span></a>
described is, that the ducts, in both cases formed by the
prolongation of the coat of an ovarian receptacle, are here
protected by a thick outer membrane, lined, at least in the
upper part, by corium; whereas, in the Lepadidæ the two
ducts are included within the peduncle, and are therefore
protected by one common membrane, lined of course by
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: coriumi">corium</span>; and this membrane, we shall presently see, is
homologous with that separately investing the two threads.</p>

<p>The antennæ differ remarkably little, considering the
anomalous character of the mature animal, from the same
organ in other genera; they come nearest, perhaps, to the
antennæ of Ibla. The length of the disc (<i>g</i>, fig. <a href="#p24f01">1</a>) and
great succeeding segment (<i>f</i>) together is 40/6000ths of an inch.
The lower segment has its basal articulation only slightly
oblique, showing that, as in <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a> and Ibla, it was
probably articulated near the anterior end of the pupal
shell: it is of nearly the same width throughout.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[154]</span></a> The
disc (<i>g</i>) is remarkable from its great proportional length;
it is hoof-shaped, with the outer side rather protuberant,
and the end pointed. The ultimate segment (<i>h</i>) is of
moderate size: as in Ibla, it has a shoulder or notch on
its inner side near its end, bearing two long spines; and
probably there were originally three or four spines on the
square broad upper end, but these have been broken. This
segment is articulated unusually near to the end of the disc.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks on the two threads by which
<a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> is attached, are, independently of their relation
to this individual animal, of considerable interest. In
my volume on the Lepadidæ, I have stated, after repeated
and rigorous examinations (for I was well aware how
singular the facts were), that in <i>Conchoderma aurita</i> and
in some other genera, the cement-ducts, which entered
the pupal antennæ, could be traced till they joined a
gland, the coat of which gland was absolutely continuous
with the coats of the adjoining and continuous ovarian
tubes, of which it was only a modified portion; and what<a name="Page_602" id="Page_602" href="#Page_602"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 602]</span></a>
was still more remarkable, that the matter within the gland
was continuous with, and differed only from, the cellular
matter within the ovarian tubes and cæca (from which
ova were in the act of formation), by being more homogeneous
and more coherent. Furthermore, I have shown,
that in Ibla an ovarian tube, becomes by a very small
change, namely, by a double flexure and slight thickening
of its coat, converted into a gland, and thus acquires the power
of affecting the cellular ovarian matter and changing it
into cement. Now, in <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, the great ovarian sack
replaces the ovarian tubes and cæca; and we here see the
very same relations even still more plainly; for the coat of
the ovarian sack is indisputably continuous with that investing
or forming the two cement-ducts within the two
threads; and immediately that the coarse cellular matter,
which within the ovarian sack is being converted into ova,
enters the upper contracted end of the cement-duct, by
some power, we must suppose, inherent in its coat, it is converted
into cement, which debouches with all its usual
properties through the pupal antennæ. I may venture to
reaffirm that nothing could be plainer than this structure,
or be in more striking conformity with my previous observations,
given in the introduction to the Lepadidæ.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I can hardly express the perplexity which I felt when I
first examined <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, and when I naturally mistook
the mouth for the entire head, for I saw, as I thought, the
antennæ in direct connection with the second segment of
the body, posteriorly to the mouth! It was quite as monstrous
and incredible an inversion of the laws of nature, as
those fabulous half-human monsters, with an eye seated in
the middle of their stomachs. After a time, I perceived
that the following considerations removed all difficulty, and
brought <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> into the type of other cirripedes.</p>

<p><i>Firstly</i>: in ordinary cirripedes, the two cement-ducts can
be traced up from the cemented antennæ to the glands,
formed by a part of the ovarian branching cæca; and the
latter can be traced to where they enter, as two simple
tubes, the body of the animal, at a medio-dorsal point, a<a name="Page_603" id="Page_603" href="#Page_603"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 603]</span></a>
little anteriorly to the prosoma, or second thoracic segment.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[155]</span></a>
From what is actually seen in the complemental male of
<i>Scalpellum Peronii</i>, and from what may be inferred from the
structure of these parts in the pupæ of all cirripedes, there
can be no doubt that if the ovarian cæca were in any case
not developed, the cement-ducts would enter the body at the
spot where the two simple ovarian tubes, which serve to unite
the ovarian cæca with the true ovaria, do enter. Now if we
look at the drawing (Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f07">7</a>) of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, we shall
see that the cement-ducts enter the body at a medio-dorsal
point, a little anteriorly to the second thoracic segment, and
therefore in the normal position.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_155_155" id="Footnote_155_155"></a><a href="#FNanchor_155_155"><span class="label">[155]</span></a> This may be partially seen in the section, fig. <a href="#p25f01">1</a>, of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, on the
same plate (<a href="#Page_709">25</a>) with the figure of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>; here (bearing in mind that
<a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> is a much modified form) (<i>z</i>) shows the pupal antennæ, within which,
whilst young, the cement-ducts are included, and are directly continuous with
the layer of branching ovarian cæca (<i>g</i>), which are prolonged up to the ovaria
as a pair of simple tubes (only one being here represented), entering the body
above the upper margin of the prosoma (<i>c</i>). The prosoma of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, I may add,
answers to the segment <sup>2</sup> <i>t</i> in fig. <a href="#p25f07">7</a> of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>; (<i>e</i>) the mouth in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>,
of course corresponding with (<i>m</i>) the mouth of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>; the segment <sup>1</sup> <i>c</i> and
<sup>2</sup> <i>t</i> of the latter, are in <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a> aborted or confluent, at least on the ventral surface;
and, lastly, the whole great shell of <a href="#Genus_Balanus">Balanus</a>, the sack with its muscles and the
branchiæ, and the opercular valves with their muscles, are all represented in
<a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> merely by the outer membrane of the two threads (<i>g</i>), which enter
the pupal antennæ!</p></div>

<p><i>Secondly</i>: the external membrane of the two threads,
investing the two cement-ducts, it should be remembered, is
not moulted, and is added to during growth (being lined
internally by corium), only round the upper, collar-like edge.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>: the external covering or carapace of every young
cirripede, at the period of its metamorphosis, enters, at its
lower end, the cemented antennæ, in the form of two short
tubular prolongations, by which alone, at first, the cirripede
adheres to the surface of attachment; within these prolongations
the cement-ducts are included. I have, moreover,
seen instances, as in <i>Conchoderma aurita</i> and in the male of
Ibla and <a href="#Genus_Alcippe">Alcippe</a>, in which these tubular prolongations, lined
internally by corium, were increased a little in length, so as
to form a trouser-like termination to the peduncle. That
the forked extremity should be a little more developed, and
so be converted into a pair of short tubular threads, cannot
be considered as very improbable.</p>

<p><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604" href="#Page_604"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 604]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>: in the male Ibla the capitulum is so much
atrophied that it does not <span class="correction" title="In the original book: inclose">enclose</span> the thorax or mouth, but
still an elongated support or peduncle is left. But it
would be no very violent assumption to imagine the
peduncle, which does not essentially differ from the capitulum,
to become likewise rudimental,—to grow smaller and
smaller, and shorter and shorter, till the merest remnant was
left at the spot where it entered the cemented antennæ.
And in the last paragraph it has been shown that it would
be no violent assumption to imagine this lower end of the
peduncle, where it enters the antennæ, developed into
two short thread-like prolongations.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>: it is certain, from the existence of the prehensile
antennæ, that <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> was developed within a
pupa, probably differing in no very essential respect from
the pupæ of other cirripedes. Therefore, in accordance
with all analogy, we may believe that the position<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize0p8">[156]</span></a> of
the young <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a> (probably much coiled up, with a
deep fold close under the mouth) within the pupa, the general
form and structure of the latter, and the course of the<a name="Page_605" id="Page_605" href="#Page_605"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 605]</span></a>
cement-ducts, did not <em>essentially</em> differ from the imaginary
figure given, Pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f06">6</a>. Now, at the period of the
metamorphosis, let us imagine that no general covering or
carapace was formed, except a small portion on the ventral
surface, round the cemented antennæ. Let us further
suppose this remnant to be specially developed (as in the
case of some cirripedes) into a short trouser-like prolongation,
entering the antennæ; and subsequently, in accordance
with the almost universal laws of growth in cirripedes,
that this portion was never moulted, but continued
to be added to, during growth, only at its upper end. By
this means we should produce every leading peculiarity
of the <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta"><i>Proteolepas bivincta</i></a>. As this parasite lives within
the sack of another cirripede, and is protected by the capitulum
of the latter, we can understand, in accordance with
the usual admirable economy of nature, the absence of any
general covering for its body. We can now, also, understand
the structure and manner of growth of the two threads
by which it is bound to its prey; and the connection, at first
so strange and perplexing, between the old pupal antennæ
and the second segment of the thorax. I am convinced that
no other explanation than that here given, will accord with
the relations of the several parts and organs of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>.
Consequently, I fully believe that we here see an articulate
animal in which the whole of the three anterior segments
of the head have been, during the act of metamorphosis,
absolutely aborted, with the exception of a mere rudiment
on the ventral surface, near the anterior end, round the old
antennæ, and which rudiment has been specially developed
as a covering for the two cement-ducts. As the pupal
antennæ are, homologically, the second pair of antennæ, we
may further infer that this modified remnant of the carapace,
investing the two threads, belongs to the third cephalic
segment.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_156_156" id="Footnote_156_156"></a><a href="#FNanchor_156_156"><span class="label">[156]</span></a> Any one who has not specially attended to the metamorphoses of ordinary
cirripedes, who looks at the imaginary figure of the young <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, will
feel much surprise at the relative positions of the parts; for the mouth and
the first and even second segments of the body stand posteriorly (<i>i. e.</i> above in
the figure) to the succeeding segments of the body, in relation to the carapace of
the pupa; but this is only in accordance with the remarkable change in position
(as explained in the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">introduction</a>, p. <a href="#Page_123">123</a>, pl. <a href="#Page_714">30</a>, fig. <a href="#p30f02">2</a>), amounting almost
to inversion, which the whole thorax of every young cirripede undergoes within
the pupa, whilst the anterior cephalic portions and general covering are developed
conformably with the pupal carapace, whence it arises that the <i>dorsal</i>
surface of that part of the thorax immediately succeeding the mouth becomes
attached to the <i>ventral</i> internal surface of the carapace. I believe that the
peculiar flattened dorsal outline of the first two segments of the body of <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>
is due to these parts having been formed in contact (as represented in
pl. <a href="#Page_709">25</a>, fig. <a href="#p25f06">6</a>) with the straight ventral surface of the carapace of the pupa. To
place the young <a href="#Proteolepas_bivincta">Proteolepas</a>, and at the same time the carapace of the pupa,
with all the parts in proper homological sequence, it would be necessary to
seize the posterior end of the abdomen (<i>a</i>), and pull till the dorsal surfaces of
the first and second segments of the body, separated from the ventral internal
surface of the carapace, and stood posteriorly (<i>i. e.</i> above in figure) to the mouth,
which latter would thus also have to rotate a quarter of a circle, so that the
orifice would come to be directed outwards. Then every part would stand,
in accordance with the archetype crustacean structure, in due order; but the
three confluent anterior cephalic segments, forming the front part and carapace
of the pupa, would, as in the case of all cirripedes, be of disproportionately large
size in relation to the rest of the body.</p>

after the exuviation of the bivalve-like pupal carapace, the
basal segments of the antennæ, the eye-apodemes and eyes.
The young cirripede has just assumed its proper position
at nearly right angles to what it held whilst packed within
the pupa,—this change of position having been effected by
the opening out or stretching of the deep fold of membrane
(see <i>n</i>, in fig. 2) formed over the eye-apodemes and
eyes, previous to the act of exuviation.</li>
<li class="plate3"><i>a</i>, the three terminal segments of the antennæ of the pupa, still

have examined some more specimens, sent me by Mr. Wood, which
show that <i>Balanus concavus</i> and <i>Hameri</i> are found in the Red Crag;
and that <i>Verruca Strömia</i> is found in the Coralline Crag; this will
make the total in the Coralline Crag <span class="correction" title="In the original book: nine">ten</span>, and in the Red Crag eight.
I should, however, add, that the identification of <i>Verruca Strömia</i>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
